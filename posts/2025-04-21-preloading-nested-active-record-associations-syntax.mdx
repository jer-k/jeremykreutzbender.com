_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

I recently opened a Pull Request where I was including nested associations in an
[Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) query
and received feedback that syntax was unfamiliar. It hadn't crossed my mind that this syntax would be unfamiliar to
others so I wrote up an explanation in a comment about what was happening, the Pull Request was approved and the feature
was shipped. However, that got me thinking that I would like to share the syntax and do a little exploration as to why
it might have been unfamiliar to others. The query in question looked something like this.

## The query syntax in question

```ruby
User.includes(team: :organization)
```

If this looks unfamiliar, let's set up the context.

```ruby
class Organization < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :teams
end

class Team < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :organization
  has_many :users
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :team
end
```

We have three models in a three level hierarchy where `Organization` is at the top, `Team` is in the middle, and `User`
is at the bottom. The syntax of the query is saying for all the `User` records we look up, we also want to load
the associated `Team` record as well as the `Organization` that the `Team` belongs to. This loading of associated
records is the resolution to the classic N+1 problem where it could be possible to hit the database multiple times
as we loop through each `User` record. Let's look at a quick example to clarify the N+1 problem.

```ruby
# N+1 problem. We query the database for the Team and Organization record on every loop
User.where(...).map do |user|
  {
    name: user.name,
    team_name: user.team.name, # This issues a query to the database
    organization_name: user.team.organization.name # This issues another query to the database
  }
end

# No N+1. We have preloaded all the associated records
User.includes(team: :organization).where(...).map do |user|
  {
    name: user.name,
    team_name: user.team.name,
    organization_name: user.team.organization.name
  }
end
```

Now that we understand what the syntax is doing and why it is useful, let's explore why it might be unfamiliar.

## Why is this syntax unfamiliar?

I think the reason this syntax is unfamiliar is because it isn't mentioned in the
[Active Record Query Interface](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) documentation. The
documentation has many examples of using `.includes` and I picked out the three different types to show here.

```ruby
Book.includes(:author)

Customer.includes(:orders, :reviews)

Customer.includes(orders: { books: [:supplier, :author] })
```

Let's break down what each of these are doing.

```ruby
Book.includes(:author)
```

This example showcases that a `Book` is related to an `author` via a `belongs_to` or `has_one` association.

```ruby
Customer.includes(:orders, :reviews)
```

This example showcases that a `Customer` has two relationships, `has_many :orders` and `has_many :reviews`. We're
preloading both associations so that we don't have to make additional trips to the database to later load the data.
Note that this isn't an N+1 example, these two relationships load lists and can be all fetched at once. This example
could also be written like this.

```ruby
Customer.includes([:orders, :reviews])
```

The change to using array syntax is minor, but it demonstrates that associations that belong to the model can be
encapsulated into an array. We see this syntax put to work in the final example.

```ruby
Customer.includes(orders: { books: [:supplier, :author] })
```

This example builds on the previous in a more nested manner. We now see that the `Order` class `has_many :books` and
each `Book` is related to a `supplier` and an `author` via a `belongs_to` or `has_one` association. We know that
we can encapsulate associations to the same model through the array syntax and that approach is used here to
preload multiple associations to `Book`.

Now that we understand different approaches to the preloading syntax, let's revisit the syntax of our original query
and rewrite it to match the documentation.

```ruby
# Original
User.includes(team: :organization)

# Rewritten to match the documentation
User.includes(team: [:organization])
```

The original query is omitting the array syntax around `:organization` because we're only loading a single
association and that is perfectly valid syntax!

## Conclusion

I found an answer to a question on Stack Overflow,
[Rails - Nested includes on Active Records?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24397716/1118848) from 2014 that may be
the source of where I learned this syntax. The answer shows some examples of how to build up a structure of extremely
nested associations which shouldn't look unfamiliar now that we've covered the basics here. Hopefully this helps
the next time when writing or reviewing some Active Record code!
