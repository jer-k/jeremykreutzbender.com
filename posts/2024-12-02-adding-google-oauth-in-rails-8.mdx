In my previous post talking about Rails 8 authentication,
[Adding Email Address Verification in Rails 8](/blog/adding-email-address-verification-in-rails-8), I walked through
adding user creation and email address verification to the scaffolded code that the new Rails 8 authentication
generator added. However, not everyone wants to deal with typing in a password to sign in and Google OAuth provides
a great alternative as most people have a Gmail account that can be used. I wanted to share how I added this flow
with only the [oauth2](https://gitlab.com/oauth-xx/oauth2) gem as a lot of the guides I looked through were
reliant on [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) or [omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth).
While those are great options to implement OAuth, I wanted to implement something that was less of a black box.
This implementation won't include any UI elements as there are too many options for building UI and what I prefer
may not be what someone reading prefers. At the conclusion of this article your backend code will be ready to support
any UI implementation.

## Identity Model

We'll start off by creating a migration for our `Identity` model. In this case we're only adding Google OAuth but
in a larger application we might end up supporting multiple identity providers. We want to ensure that our
`Identity` model is provider agnostic and not coupled to any specific provider attribute names so we'll be adding
a couple very generic columns to our `identities` table and associating the records to our `User` model.

```ruby:db/migrate/<timestamp>_add_identities.rb
class AddIdentities < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :identities do |t|
      t.references :user, index: true, null: false
      t.string :provider_name, null: false
      t.string :provider_uid, null: false

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby:app/models/identity.rb
class Identity < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

Optionally, we can add a `has_one :identity` or `has_many :identities` to `user.rb` but for this walkthrough
we won't be looking up the association that way.

## Routes

Next, we'll need routes to allow users to navigate through the OAuth flow. I decided to put these routes
under `/oauth` but there is no requirement that this naming scheme be followed. We'll create
two routes, `/oauth/authorize` and `oauth/callback`, where `authorize` is used to generate our Google
OAuth url and `callback` is where Google will redirect the user back to after authenticating.

```ruby:config/routes.rb
resource :oauth, only: %i[], controller: "oauth" do
  collection do
    get :authorize
    get :callback
  end
end
```

Remember that we're only implementing Google OAuth but if we wanted to implement multiple identity
providers then the route structure would need to be different. In that scenario we would want to have
routes of `/oauth/:provider/authorize` and `/oauth/:provider/callback`.

## OAuth Controller

Now we'll implement our controller. We'll split this into two parts, implementing `#authorize` and then `#callback`.
In `#authorize`, as mentioned before, we want to generate the url that Google expects to start the OAuth flow
and redirect our user to that url.

### authorize route

```ruby:app/controllers/oauth_controller.rb
class OauthController < ApplicationController
  allow_unauthenticated_access

  def authorize
    google_url = authorize_client.auth_code.authorize_url(
      redirect_uri: callback_oauth_url,
      scope: "openid email profile",
      access_type: "online",
    )
    redirect_to google_url, allow_other_host: true
  end

  private

  def authorize_client
    @authorize_client ||= OAuth2::Client.new(
      ENV["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"],
      ENV["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"],
      {
        site: "https://accounts.google.com",
        authorize_url: "/o/oauth2/auth",
      }
    )
  end
end
```

#### #authorize_client

Using the `oauth2` gem, we can construct an `OAuth2::Client` object using our Google client ID and secret. If
you don't have those then I would suggest reading
[Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for a high
level overview and then [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) for
step by step instructions on generating the client ID and secret. Then we need to provide the `site` and
`authorize_url` parameters, which can be found on Google's
[Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server)
documentation.

For the `site` and `authorize_url` parameters, we can find them in the
[Step 1: Set authorization parameters](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#httprest_1) section
of the documentation.

> Google's OAuth 2.0 endpoint is at https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth. This endpoint is accessible only over HTTPS.
> Plain HTTP connections are refused.

This documentation also notes required parameters of `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `response_type`,
and `scope`.

#### authorize_url and redirect

Now we've built our `#authorize_client` method and we need to generate our Google url to redirect the user to. We
use the `OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode#authorize_url` method which accepts a set of parameters that will fulfill the required
parameters previously mentioned. For `redirect_uri`, we're using our route helper to generate the route to our `/oauth/callback`
route. For `scope`, we're requesting the ability to use the Open ID APIs to access to the user's email address and profile information.
We're also passing an optional parameter for `access_type` and setting it to `online` because we don't need access to the
Google APIs when the user isn't active on the application. Finally, `response_type` is added for us in `#authorize_url` and the
value is `code`. The url we end up redirecting to looks like this.

```
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth/oauthchooseaccount?access_type=online&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Foauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=openid%20email%20profile&service=lso&o2v=1&ddm=1&flowName=GeneralOAuthFlow
```

When a user visits that url, they'll be shown the Sign in with Google page and after selecting a Google account to sign in with,
they'll be redirected back to our `/oauth/callback` route.

### callback route

I decided to keep this walk through straightforward and put all the code in the controller instead of creating a
class to encompass the following logic. However, I would recommend keeping your controllers succinct and moving
business logic into a class. With that said, let's take a look at the implementation.

```ruby:app/controllers/oauth_controller.rb
class OauthController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def callback
    token = token_client.auth_code.get_token(
      params[:code],
      redirect_uri: callback_oauth_url
    )
    user_info_response = token.get("https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo")
    user_info = JSON.parse(user_info_response.body)

    email_address = user_info["email"]
    uid = user_info["sub"]

    identity = Identity.find_or_initialize_by(provider_name: "Google", provider_uid: uid)
    user = if identity.user
      identity.user
    else
      password = SecureRandom.hex(16)
      new_user = User.new(
        email_address: email_address,
        password: password,
        password_confirmation: password,
      )
      identity.user = new_user
      new_user
    end

    if identity.save
      start_new_session_for(user)
      # Handle valid case: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    else
      # Handle invalid case (likely an email address collision): render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    end
  end

  private

  def token_client
    @token_client ||= OAuth2::Client.new(
      ENV["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"],
      ENV["GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"],
      {
        site: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com",
        token_url: "/token"
      }
    )
  end
  # ...
end
```

There is a lot of code here so we'll break it down into a couple pieces.

#### #token_client

In the Google documentation,
[Step 5: Exchange authorization code for refresh and access tokens](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#exchange-authorization-code)
we see that we need to call a different API to get an access token.

> To exchange an authorization code for an access token, call the https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token endpoint

We'll build another client method, `#token_client` which uses the `token_url` parameter and will allow us to exchange
the authorization code for an access token.

#### #get_token

Now we can use `OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode#get_token` to receive our token from Google. We need to pass the `code` we received
in the parameters as well as the same `redirect_uri` we used when generating the `authorize_url`. After receiving the `token`,
we can use that token as a client to request the user information.

#### /userinfo API Call

<Aside>
  While figuring out what the API to request the user information was, I
  discovered
  [accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration).
  This appears to the most up to date configuration for all things related to
  [OpenID
  Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect),
  which has a generic walkthrough of the same steps we've been covering. It also
  covers the API to get the user information and what fields are available.
</Aside>

Using our token, we can make a call to `https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo` to get our user information.
I've skipped adding error handling on that API call for now, but we should definitely handle a case where we don't
receive a valid response. We'll parse the response and extract the user's email address and unique identifier.

#### Identity and User Creation

Now that we have a unique identifier from Google, we can go ahead and start building our `Identity` record. Because
an OAuth flow can be used to sign up or sign in, we need to use `Identity.find_or_initialize_by`. In the case
where we already have the `Identity` record, we only need to get the `User` record attached to the `Identity`. However,
if the user is signing up, we need to create a new `User` record and attach it to the `Identity`. The last step is to
attempt to save the `Identity` record.

If the save is successful, then we've completed our OAuth flow and we can start a new session for our user. They're ready
to use our application! However, if the save isn't successful, due to say, using an email address that already exists in
the database, we'll have to determine how we want to handle that case.

## Dealing with Email Address Collisions

When offering email address and password authentication as well as an OAuth flow, there is a good chance that a user will
end up attempting to use both approaches with the same email address due to forgetting what they previously used.
In those cases we need to decide what to do when a collision occurs in each scenario.

- User exists from OAuth, tries to use email address + password
- User exists with email address + password, tries to use OAuth

I will give my opinion on these, however these are just opinions and a different approach can be taken based on the needs
of the application.

### User exists from OAuth, tries to use email address + password

We'll start with this scenario as I think it is more straightforward than the other. In the case where a user exists
and was created through an OAuth flow, they will have a password in the database, but that password is unknown to them.
If they are trying to log in through email address and password, it is near impossible for them enter a correct password
and the application should return it's generic error message that the given email address and password combination
was incorrect.

It is possible that we could inspect the `User` record to see if it has an associated `Identity` record to understand
that an OAuth flow was used. We could create a custom error message in that scenario indicating that an OAuth flow was
used with the email address that is attempting to be used for sign in. Doing this will complicate the sign in logic
and does lend to revealing what email addresses have accounts in the application, but directing users to the correct
way to sign in may lead to better user experiences.

### User exists with email address + password, tries to use OAuth

This scenario has a few different options where we can either reject the OAuth authentication or offer to append
the OAuth capabilities to the existing account. Let's start off with the straightforward option of rejection. When
we fail to save the `Identity` and `User` records in our `callback` route, that will be due to the email address
already being in use on a different `User` record. We can return an error message to the user that the sign in was
a failure. [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) uses this approach and presents a nice message of
`Sign-in using Google auth failed` prompting me to remember that I used email address and password to create my account
there.

The other option is to offer to append the OAuth capabilities onto the existing account, which in terms of our Rails
application means finding the existing `User` record and creating an `Identity` attached to that record. While that
seems not so complicated, it brings up a question of do we allow for both email address and password sign in as well as
OAuth sign in? Or do we generate a randomized password for them and only allow for OAuth sign in moving forward? I don't
have a strong opinion here, but my first reaction is that having multiple ways to sign in feels confusing and we should
be aiming to lead users through good experiences. With that said, maybe allowing for multiple ways to sign in is a good
experience because the users don't have to remember what they did before.

## Conclusion

I hope you were able to learn something about implementing an OAuth flow and if you're working on a Rails 8 project that
has used the authentication generator, you were able to add Google OAuth to your application. I tend to click that
sign in with Google button on every application so I think it is a very useful feature to have and helps with creating
great user experiences!
