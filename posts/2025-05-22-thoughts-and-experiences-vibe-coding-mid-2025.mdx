_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

I've been reflecting on the changes I've made in my approach to programming related to using more AI tools
and I wanted to share some thoughts I had on vibe coding. For context,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) describes it
> Vibe coding (or vibecoding) is a programming paradigm dependent on artificial intelligence (AI), where a person
> describes a problem in a few sentences as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding. The
> LLM generates software, shifting the programmer's role from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining the
> AI-generated source code.

I want to add to the description that my personal take on vibe coding is that there is a lot less upfront reading
and understanding of the code being generated and much more going with the flow to get something working. Going with
the flow of the code being generated and trying to get to an initial point of the code working is an amazing way
to get a product or feature started. The Wikipedia article agrees with this take

> A key part of the definition of vibe coding is that the user accepts code without full understanding. AI researcher
> Simon Willison said: "If an LLM wrote every line of your code, but you've reviewed, tested, and understood it all,
> that's not vibe coding in my bookâ€”that's using an LLM as a typing assistant."

With all that said, I want to cover a couple anecdotal experiences with vibe coding and describe what went well
and what didn't go well with each one. We'll touch on how it's easy to be left with a lot of code you don't understand,
why generating a set of tasks helps to keep the LLM on track, and how new programming languages are more accessible
than ever.

## LSP For SQL Dialect

The first project I wanted to try vibe coding on was an attempt to create an
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for a SQL-like dialect.
A key point of this project is that it is meant to go to production, have others
install it, and be open source. To me, that means I needed to understand how everything works, at least for
the first version.

The language is a subset of SQL capabilities that can only read data and
doesn't have to use `SELECT`. An example query looks like this.

```sql
(
  kubernetes.cluster_id IN ('production', 'staging')
  AND ((kubernetes.namespace = 'kube-system') OR (kubernetes.namespace = 'default'))
)
```

Starting this project having no experience with what it takes to write an LSP, I knew that I would need
a set of steps to have the LLM follow. Without that, I wouldn't have any idea if the all the LSP
functionality was being created. This is the prompt I started off with.

> I want to write an LSP that will conform to https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/. I want
> to write the project in Ruby as well. The language we'll be writing for this is a small subset of SQL. Can
> you outline a set of steps to implement this LSP that we can work together on. Some example steps would
> initializing a project or defining the language characteristics.

This is the set of steps that was returned.

> I'll help you create an LSP using Ruby. Here's a suggested breakdown of steps we can work through together:
>
> 1. Project Setup
>    - Initialize a new Ruby project
>    - Set up necessary gems (like language_server-protocol)
>    - Create basic project structure
>    - Set up testing framework
>
> 2. Define Language Specification
>    - Document the syntax and grammar
>    - Define allowed operations
>    - Specify keywords and operators
>    - Define data types
>    - Document any special rules or constraints
>
> 3. Implement Basic LSP Infrastructure
>    - Initialize connection handling
>    - Implement basic message handling
>    - Set up JSON-RPC communication
>    - Implement initialization request/response
>
> 4. Core LSP Features Implementation
>    - Text document synchronization
>    - Diagnostics
>    - Completion
>    - Hover
>    - Go to definition
>    - Symbol search
>
> 5. SQL-Specific Features
>    - Parser implementation
>    - Syntax validation
>    - Semantic analysis
>    - Query validation
>
> Would you like to start with step 1 or would you prefer to begin with step 2 so I can better understand
> the language we're working with?

### What Went Well

This was the first time I had tried out this approach of generating a list of steps for the LLM to follow instead
of prompting on the go. The steps gave LLM the framework to not get lost and continue working towards a goal.
After completing a bullet point, I would ask the LLM to review the list of steps and add check marks to everything
that had been completed. Typically in its response, the LLM would suggest some of the bullet points to work on next
and that pattern is how I progressed through this set of initial steps. I've since adopted this pattern into all my
LLM usage where I'm setting out on a larger task. My favorite sentence to add is "We don't need to write any code right
now! We're only generating a list of steps that we need to complete."

In going through the steps, I generated classes for all the LSP features as well as a passing test suite for each one.
It appeared that features like autocomplete, hover tooltips, and errors for invalid syntax were all in
place and ready to go. As each feature got checked off and the tests continued to pass, I grew more and more excited
to run the LSP on a real file, not just simulate syntax in tests.

The next step was to create a VSCode extension and try the LSP for real. I wrote a prompt explaining that I wanted to
make the extension and the LLM was able to generate a second folder in the project containing all the Typescript
code needed to generate the extension. I ran the script to generate the extension, installed it into VSCode, and
created a file to start playing around with the autocomplete features. And then nothing worked. No autocomplete,
no underlining incorrect syntax, no hover information.

The whole time I had a false sense that everything was working due to all the tests passing but after seeing
nothing work in VSCode, I needed to figure out what was going on. Thankfully I was able to prompt the LLM about
how to add logging to the extension and how to view those logs in VSCode. I came to find out the extension was
immediately crashing when it started.

### What Didn't Go Well

After finding out the VSCode extension was immediately crashing, I needed to start debugging what was going on and
I realized that I didn't know where any of the code was located or how any of it intertwined. Throughout the
initial process of building everything, I had blindly accepted code, checked that tests worked, and moved on without
spending any time understanding what had been generated. I was definitely embracing the good vibes and it felt
great from a productivity standpoint but I ended up having to do a ton of work to start the debugging process.

To start, I spent a lot of time reading through all the generated code to understand what it was doing.
Because Ruby is my primary language of choice, I was able to understand everything, however had I chosen
a different language for this project, it would have taken me substantially longer. After getting a grasp on it all,
I manually refactored everything into a mental model that made sense to me. Now the project was in a place where
I could start adding logging and debugging what was going on only to discover there were a plethora of problems.

I started a second iteration of vibe coding that followed a pattern of fix a bug, compile VSCode extension, install
extension, see logs for a new bug, feed bug back into the LLM. New code would be generated, I understand and apply any
additional manual edits to that code, and repeat. As I paid closer attention to the code being generated I noticed many
of the features that I thought had been previously completed were actually lacking in their implementation. Following
this new pattern led to a far more successful iteration and I did not run into any further major issues.

### Takeaways

* A large list of steps or tasks is extremely useful as it can be referenced over and over to guide work
* Building a project that is based on a specification, like an LSP, allows the LLM to confidently generate code and tests
* Moving from task to task without reviewing the code being written leads to a huge knowledge gap when
debugging needs to occur

## API Endpoints For My Personal Website (Next.js)

With all the hype for [Model Context Proptocols](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) an interesting
idea caught my eye, which was to build a personal MCP. The premise of a personal MCP is a way for someone
to ask questions about me and the LLM to be able to use the MCP to better answer those questions. An example
I thought of would be someone asking "What topics does Jeremy blog about?" An API endpoint could provide
all the metadata about my blog post posts so that is what I set out to build. An awesome
thing about Next.js is that not only can it render the contents of this website but it can also act
as an API server. All my blog content is already checked into this repository so building an API to
return that data would be no problem at all.

### What Went Well

I had started working on building these APIs before I realized that this would be a perfect opportunity to let an
LLM take over the work. There were only a handful of endpoints that needed to be implemented and none were very
complex so there isn't a lot to say here. The LLM ended up being able to finish everything rather quickly as it was
able to examine what I had already implemented and then apply that to the rest of the endpoints.

This leads me to believe that when vibe coding on an existing project, loading similar examples of what
I want to get done into the context will make the experience go smoother. I don't want to let LLM generate code
that doesn't match what already exists or to generate code in places it shouldn't.

### What Didn't Go Well

The only issue I ran into when testing the APIs was that I had written a route as `/api/blogs/slug/route.ts` and
quickly realized it needed to be `/api/blogs/[slug]/route.ts`. This was my fault, I had pre-written all the routes and
didn't ask the LLM to generate any of the files. Otherwise, all the code that was generated worked as expected.

### Takeaways

* Giving explicit context with existing files or code references up front seems to work best
* Small, well defined tasks ensure that the code being generated stays contained to a single area of the project
* Having prior experience with what is being generated, in this case it was Next.js API routes, is beneficial when testing the generated code afterwards

## Git TUI In Go

For my last experience, after I started writing this article I decided I want to give in fully to vibes and
see if I could get a project working by letting the agent do all of the coding. I recalled a friend of mine
talking about [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and thought that a TUI to view git commits
would be a perfect type of project for this experiment. I don't really know Go so my ability to make changes
to this project would be pretty limited and that is exactly what I wanted! I decided there would be no
manual changes from me and anything that needed to be fixed would be done via prompts. The end result
was [go-git-tui-vibes](https://github.com/jer-k/go-git-tui-vibes).

I initialized an empty directory and wrote this prompt.

> This is a blank project called `go-git-tui`. I don't have a ton of experience
> with Go, but I've been wanting to learn. What I want to build is a TUI (Terminal UI) application that has one
> function, which is to view the git commits of a repository in a carousel fashion. Imagine each commit being a
> fixed width wide and we display all the information about it vertically.
> At the bottom of the box, I want a colored dot. If you take the 6 characters of a commit sha, it is a valid
> hex color so the colored dot will be based off that. I want all the dots displayed on the screen to have a
> line connecting them together. The line should be a gradient of the two hex colors.
> Finally, we will show as many commits as possible on the screen (based on the width of each commit box and the
> width of the terminal window) and users should be able to scroll using the arrow keys.
>
> Before you write any code, can you come up with a plan for implementing this project?

Throughout the day, I would write prompts to make changes and go back to doing something else. As the project was
getting closer to completion, I spent a focused 30 minutes prompting fix some issues get the project to a place
I felt happy in stopping at. The result was the project worked but the look didn't quite match my initial description;
it was close but I wouldn't ship this UI to customers.

## What Went Well

I would say that ending up with a working piece of software means this experience went well! Here is the end
result of the TUI.

![go-git-tui](/post_images/thoughts-on-vibe-coding/go-git-tui.png)

While the project was relatively simple and is by no means production ready, the fact that it is written in a
language I don't know and I didn't have to manually edit anything is very exciting to me. Now don't go jumping
to conclusions, I'm **not** trying to say that AI is going to replace software engineering jobs or anything like
that. This result is exciting to me because it showcases a new way of learning. I now have a working program in Go
that I can start tinkering with and learning from. I've always found it daunting to try to dive into a huge open
source repository and try to learn from it. I tried to learn Go by doing this with Docker's
[buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx) repository when I was running into weird bugs on my build server and
it didn't go well.

The other part of this experiment that I felt went really well was the asynchronous nature in which the project
was built. As I mentioned before, throughout the day I would write a prompt and go back to doing something else.
This allowed me to make progress on multiple things at once and all I had to do when I came back to this project
was rebuild and run it to see what changed in the TUI. I would pick out something that was wrong, write a prompt,
and then go back to doing something else. Sometimes I would come right back and repeat the process, other times it
would be an hour before I made it back. Either way, I was really happy with the way it progressed and it leads me
to believe that leaning in on this asynchronous path **might** be an amazing productivity boost.

## What Didn't Go Well

This experiment really suffered from a two steps forward, one step backward process. It really
felt like every time I would write a prompt to make a tiny adjustment to the TUI, the LLM would attempt to fix what
I asked and break something else in the process. Attempting to get the line with a gradient to connect the dots
in the commit boxes was probably 10 to 15 prompts of the line moving and breaking things. The line would
move down and the boxes would suddenly have extra vertical whitespace or the border of the boxes
would be messed up. I really wanted to jump into the code and figure it out myself but I was also curious to see
what result I could get through only prompting. In the end, I didn't get the exact result I wanted but the commit
boxes looked fine so I called it quits at that point.

### Takeaways

* It is possible to create small contained projects from scratch that work
* When trying to solve a very specific task, it is possible to stumble creating a two steps forward, one step back process
* There is potential for learning programming languages or how features of a language work from building projects as
an alternative to tutorials

## Conclusion

These three projects have helped me learn a lot about what the future of programming may look like. I think we'll all take
different approaches and use LLMs in different ways that suit our individual and even project level needs. Some of us
will value the velocity that vibe coding can achieve while others will sacrifice some of that speed for a better
understanding of the code that is generated. Both approaches will be viable, it will come down to personal preference.
Currently, my personal preference on vibe coding is that it isn't for me for projects that I intend to maintain for long
periods of time. I want to understand the code that is being committed so that if a problem arises and I need to debug
something I'm ready to dive in. Or if a co-worker asks me a question about what the code is doing, I won't be reading
through the code for the first time myself. I want to go back to a quote from the start of this article.

> Simon Willison said: "If an LLM wrote every line of your code, but you've reviewed, tested, and understood it all,
> that's not vibe coding in my bookâ€”that's using an LLM as a typing assistant."

This summary perfectly encapsulates my current view. I want to use the LLM as an assistant to help me generate code
but I also want to understand that code, to make stylistic adjustments, and be cognizant of how that code intertwines
into the rest of the project. The capabilities of LLMs have changed a lot over the past year so I hope to revisit this
topic in the future to see if my view has stayed consistent or will have changed.
