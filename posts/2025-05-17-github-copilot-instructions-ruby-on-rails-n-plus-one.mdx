  A new feature for GitHub CoPilot, called Instructions, can be used to catch N+1 queries in
  Ruby on Rails applications. It can even leave comments on Pull Requests when it finds them!

_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

I was recently helping investigate a customer issue at work and one of my coworkers tracked down the issue to
a repeated database call while looping through a very large CSV file. It wasn't the typical N+1 scenario that we
come across when building Ruby on Rails applications but the outcome was the same, the code was executing slower
than desired. We were able to fix this problem by memoizing the database call
and everything started working again but it got me thinking, is there a way to catch these sort of problems ahead
of time?

My first thought was that we could attempt to write a [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) rule but this
problem is pretty nuanced. The rule would need to be able to understand all the code around it to see if a database
call was being repeated over and over. However, AI is great at understanding the context of how code is being called
and at work we've recently started having [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) review all of our
Pull Requests. I wondered if it might be possible to give CoPilot instructions on some specific things to look for
and it turns out that GitHub has released a feature exactly for this,
[CoPilot Instrunctions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)!
I tried this feature out and wrote up instructions on how CoPilot can spot this issue and if it does, instructed it
to leave a comment on the Pull Request to fix the issue. And it actually worked in a test Pull Request! With that in
mind I wanted to share more information about this feature and show how it can be used to catch the typical N+1 problem
in Rails.

## copilot-instructions.md Example

To use the CoPilot Instructions feature, add a `.github/copilot-instrunctions.md` file to your repository. There aren't
a lot of examples out there yet and I'm not sure if there are specific ways to format the instructions that may help
CoPilot differentiate between different instructions (like a header to split between instructions). Here is an
example from the documentation.

```text:.github/copilot-instructions.md
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages,
always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses
include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

As you can see the different types of instructions are only split by a line break and no special headers or syntax
has been added. I still wonder if we have longer instruction sets, as you'll see in my example below, if some
sort of indicator that a set of instructions has finished would be helpful.

## Testing Without Instructions

I spun up a brand new Rails application, scaffolded an `Account` and `User` models, and then wrote
the following code.

```ruby:users_controller.rb
# GET /users or /users.json
def index
  @users = User.all
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html  # index.html.erb
    format.json  do
      render json: @users.map do |user|
        {
          name: user.name,
          account_name: user.account.name
        }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

I committed this to a branch, pushed it up to GitHub, opened a Pull Request, and finally requested a review
by CoPilot. At this point the repository did not have any instructions added; I did this as a baseline check to
see what CoPilot thought about this code. Here is the comment it left.

![Github Copilot comment with no instructions](/post_images/github-copilot-instructions-ruby-on-rails-n-plus-one/copilot-no-instructions.png)

For the purposes of testing out these instructions, this result is great! We can see that CoPilot had a suggestion
but it did not indicate anything about an N+1 query. Now let's move onto adding the instructions and seeing
what type of results we get.

## N+1 Instructions

````text:.github/copilot-instructions.md
When reviewing Pull Requests, please look for situations that cause an N+1 query.
An example of an N+1 query is when an ActiveRecord model accesses an association in
a loop without that association have been preloaded. It will look like this
```ruby
def index
  @users_hash = User.all.map do |user|
    {
      name: user.name,
      account_name: user.account.name # This is an N+1
    }
  end
end
```

When you see this type of situation, you need to leave a comment on the offending code!
The comment should say something like "An N+1 query was noticed with the User model.
You can fix this by doing User.includes(:account)"
````

Those are the instructions that I came up with. I wanted to be explicit and add an example of what exactly an
N+1 query is so that I wasn't leaving any ambiguity around what we want CoPilot to look for. I committed these
instructions and wanted to give CoPilot a bit of a challenge because the example in the instructions looks almost
exactly like the code I added to the `UsersController` above. For a bit of a more challenging problem I updated
the `User` partial to add an N+1. Because the offending N+1 code in the partial isn't directly encompassed in a loop,
like in `UsersController`, I was curious to see if CoPilot would notice it. Here are the changes I made.

```ruby:app/views/users/_user.html.erb
<div id="<%= dom_id user %>">
  <p>
    <strong>Name:</strong>
    <%= user.name %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Account:</strong>
    <%= user.account.id %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Account Name:</strong>
    <%= user.account.name %>
  </p>

</div>
```

Again I pushed all that up, opened a Pull Request, and requested a review from CoPilot. Here is the comment it left.

![Github Copilot comment instructions but low confidence](/post_images/github-copilot-instructions-ruby-on-rails-n-plus-one/copilot-instructions-1.png)

These results are positive, but not perfect. CoPilot actually caught both N+1s which is amazing, but it thought the
comments were "low confidence". Those easily could have been missed by not expanding the very small toggle to display
them. Let's try to fix this problem and update the prompt and letting CoPilot know that if it finds any N+1s,
it should be confident in those findings and leave comments.

## Added CoPilot Confidence

```text:.github/copilot-instructions.md
... Everything above this last paragraph is the same ...

When you see this type of situation, you need to leave a comment on the offending code!
Do NOT leave "low confidence" comments, leave real comments on the offending lines of code.
The comment should say something like "An N+1 query was noticed with the User model.
You can fix this by doing User.includes(:account)"
```

I pushed this new wording up and opened a new Pull Request. Here is the comment that it left.

![Github Copilot comment instructions with confidence](/post_images/github-copilot-instructions-ruby-on-rails-n-plus-one/copilot-instructions-2.png)

I was blown away when I saw this. We are able to get detailed feedback on the exact lines of code that
would cause N+1s all with the click of a button!

## Conclusion

I'm super excited about this new CoPilot feature and I think it unlocks an amazing avenue to catching
problems that are specific to programming languages, frameworks, and even patterns in a given repository.
As with all things AI, we saw that prompt writing does play a factor in the type of results that we get so
remember to take the time to write clear and specific instructions when writing CoPilot instructions.
Send me an email on the [Contact](/contact) page with the prompt and the CoPilot comment that helps out
the most when using the feature!
