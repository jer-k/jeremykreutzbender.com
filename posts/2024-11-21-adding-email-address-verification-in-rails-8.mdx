_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

With the release of Rails 8 and a directional shift towards enabling Rails to provide more of the foundational
building blocks, one of the most interesting pieces was the authentication generator. As a long time Rails user,
the projects I've worked on have always relied on [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) as the all
in one authentication solution. While `devise` offers just about everything needed for authentication, it does so in
a way that obfuscates a lot of functionality and can make it challenging to understand exactly what is happening.
I'm not saying that obfuscation is bad when it comes to authentication and I'm definitely not saying that you need to
roll your own authentication, but having the code related to authentication written into files checked into the
repository allows for an easier understanding of what is going on. Also, if any changes need to be made to accommodate
different authentication patterns then the code is right there and ready to be changed! If you haven't already seen
the release notes for
[Generating the authentication basics](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/11/7/rails-8-no-paas-required#generating-the-authentication-basics)
from the Rails blog, go check them out and if you want a bit of a deeper dive on the code that is generated then I
suggest reading
[Rails 8 introduces a basic authentication generator](https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/rails-8-introduces-a-basic-authentication-generator)
from [Jaimy Simon](https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/authors/jaimysimon) at [Big Binary](https://www.bigbinary.com),
a Ruby on Rails development firm. This blog post notes that

> The current authentication generator supports email-password login for existing users but does not handle new account creation.

With a gap left in the implementation for registering and verifying new users I wanted to share my experience of building out
that code. This implementation won't include any UI elements as there are too many options for building UI and what I prefer
may not be what someone reading prefers. At the conclusion of this article your backend code will be ready to support
any UI implementation.

## A sidebar about [ActiveRecord::TokenFor](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/classes/ActiveRecord/TokenFor/ClassMethods.html)

That introduction was really a long winded way of saying, I learned a lot while reading the code that Rails generated
and I wanted to write a bit more about `ActiveRecord::TokenFor` as it will be used in the implementation of the email
address verification. However, if you want to skip this section, head straight to the
[Email Address Verification Implementation](#email-address-verification-implementation) section. If not, bear with me as we wander
through some Rails code.

One of the files that is generated, `app/views/passwords_mailer.html.erb`, is an email template used for resetting
a password. It looks like this

```ruby:app/views/passwords_mailer.html.erb
<p>
  You can reset your password within the next 15 minutes on
  <%= link_to "this password reset page", edit_password_url(@user.password_reset_token) %>.
</p>
```

I thought it was interesting that the password reset was only valid for 15 minutes and I wanted to know how that was being
implemented. I started out by going to the generated
[PasswordsController](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/dd8f7185faeca6ee968a6e9367f6d8601a83b8db/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/authentication/templates/app/controllers/passwords_controller.rb.tt)
and looking at the `update` route. The relevant code looks like this.

```ruby:app/controllers/passwords_controller.rb
before_action :set_user_by_token, only: %i[ edit update ]

def update
  if @user.update(params.permit(:password, :password_confirmation))
    redirect_to new_session_path, notice: "Password has been reset."
  else
    redirect_to edit_password_path(params[:token]), alert: "Passwords did not match."
  end
end

private

def set_user_by_token
  @user = User.find_by_password_reset_token!(params[:token])
rescue ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature
  redirect_to new_password_path, alert: "Password reset link is invalid or has expired."
end
```

From here, I figured the next step was going to be a quick go to definition on `User.find_by_password_reset_token!`.
However, there is no `password_reset_token` column on the `User` model so I was a bit of a loss for
where this method was being defined. Since the password code had to be included into `User` from somewhere so I opened
up `user.rb` and saw that a `has_secure_password` method was being included in the class. That method is defined in the
[ActiveModel::SecurePassword](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html) module.

When reading through the docs for `SecurePassword` there is a paragraph in the middle of it all that says

> Finally, a password reset token thatâ€™s valid for 15 minutes after issue is automatically configured when reset_token is set
> to true (which it is by default) and the object responds to generates_token_for (which Active Records do).

Perfect, we found where the 15 minute reset token is being included from but my curiosity went further because I wanted
to know how it was implemented! If you didn't know, the Rails documentation has a link to file on GitHub at the bottom of
every documentation page so I jumped over to GitHub and started looking through the implementation code, primarily searching
for something related to `15.minutes`.

I found the relevant code
[secure_password.rb#L161-L178](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/dd8f7185faeca6ee968a6e9367f6d8601a83b8db/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L161-L178)
and it looks like this.

```ruby
# Only generate tokens for records that are capable of doing so (Active Records, not vanilla Active Models)
if reset_token && respond_to?(:generates_token_for)
  generates_token_for :"#{attribute}_reset", expires_in: 15.minutes do
    public_send(:"#{attribute}_salt")&.last(10)
  end

  class_eval <<-RUBY, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
    silence_redefinition_of_method :find_by_#{attribute}_reset_token
    def self.find_by_#{attribute}_reset_token(token)
      find_by_token_for(:#{attribute}_reset, token)
    end

    silence_redefinition_of_method :find_by_#{attribute}_reset_token!
    def self.find_by_#{attribute}_reset_token!(token)
      find_by_token_for!(:#{attribute}_reset, token)
    end
  RUBY
end
```

Finding that `15.minutes` call led to the discovery of where `User.find_by_password_reset_token!` was being defined as well.
As expected, it is a dynamically defined method based on the attribute that is being used for the password. The
`has_secure_password` method actually takes in an `attribute` parameter which defaults to `:password` allowing for customization
of a different name. This was great, I had found where and how the token was being set up. One last thing caught
my eye were the `respond_to?(:generates_token_for)` and `generates_token_for` method calls.

The comment above this code mentions that all `ActiveRecord` objects are capable of using these methods but I hadn't ever
used them before. I wanted to know what they were so I went searching for where `#generates_token_for` was defined. It happens
to be in [ActiveRecord::TokenFor](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/classes/ActiveRecord/TokenFor/ClassMethods.html).

The first paragraph of the documentation gives a great summary of what this module is used for.

> Defines the behavior of tokens generated for a specific purpose. A token can be generated by calling TokenFor#generate_token_for
> on a record.
> Later, that record can be fetched by calling find_by_token_for (or find_by_token_for!) with the same purpose and token.

This is a really cool feature and something I totally missed in the Rails 7.1 release notes. I read through a number of blog posts
and
[Rails 7.1 adds ActiveRecord::Base::generates_token_for](https://www.shakacode.com/blog/rails-7-1-introduces-active-record-generates_token_for/)
did what I thought was the best job describing what the predecessor to this functionality was and going into more details about
why `#generates_token_for` is a better approach than using a manually generated UUID.

Now that we've wandered around through some Rails code and understand how the password reset token is being generated, let's
write some code to create and verify some users!

## Email Address Verification Implementation

To start out, this is a reminder that no UI code will be presented here, we're only going to build the backend
implementation. Another note is I've referred to this feature as 'email address verification' but if you want to swap
the word 'verification' with 'confirmation', this feature is commonly referred to that way as well. Let's get
started.

### User Creation

We're starting off with the first step of actually creating our `User` records. We'll create our `UsersController` and
our `#create` method. We'll use
[ActionController::ParamsWrapper](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/classes/ActionController/ParamsWrapper.html) to
to add `password` and `password_confirmation` into our `user` hash in the params, as those two attributes are not
columns on `User`, only `password_digest` is, but are required by `has_secure_password`. We'll also use the new
Rails 8
[ActionController::Parameters#expect](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-expect)
to build our `#user_create_params` method.

> `expect` is the preferred way to require and permit parameters. It is safer than the previous recommendation to call
> `permit` and `require` in sequence, which could allow user triggered 500 errors.

```ruby:app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  allow_unauthenticated_access only: [ :create ]
  wrap_parameters :user, include: User.attribute_names + [ :password, :password_confirmation ]

  def create
    @user = User.new(create_user_params)

    if @user.save!
      start_new_session_for(@user)
      UserMailer.verify_email_address(@user).deliver_later
      # Handle valid case: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    else
      # Handle invalid case: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    end
  end

  private

  def create_user_params
    params.expect(user: [ :email_address, :password, :password_confirmation ])
  end
end
```

We'll circle back on implementing `UserMailer.verify_email_address(@user)` but for now we're set up for creating
our `User` records.

### Verification Concern

Now we'll build a Concern similar to `has_secure_password`. We'll use the same pattern with `.generates_token_for`
to create a token that can be sent in an email and used to find the `User` record associated with the token later on.

```ruby:app/models/concerns/email_address_verification.rb
module EmailAddressVerification
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  class_methods do
    def has_email_address_verification
      generates_token_for(:email_address_verification, expires_in: 24.hours)

      def self.find_by_email_address_verification_token(token)
        find_by_token_for(:email_address_verification, token)
      end
    end
  end

  def email_address_verification_token
    generate_token_for(:email_address_verification)
  end
end
```

I decided that 24 hours was a good amount of time to allow for the email address to be verified; we could allow for longer
but it depends on if we're going to restrict access to the application until the verification has happened or not.
This concern also creates a helper method `.find_by_email_address_verification_token` in a similar fashion to the
`.find_by_password_reset_token` that is included with `has_secure_password`. Finally we have
`#email_address_verification_token` which can be called to generate the actual token. Note that this method calls
`#generate_token_for`, without the `s`. The `.generates_token_for` method describes the ability for the class to generate
tokens for a given purpose.

In `user.rb` we'll have the following.

```ruby:app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  ...

  include EmailAddressVerification
  has_email_address_verification

  ...
end
```

With all our token generation ready to go, let's write our email.

### Verification Mailer

I decided to include this verification in `UserMailer`. We could have made an `EmailAddressVerificationMailer` similar to
the `PasswordsMailer` so we'll leave that choice up to the reader. The `#verify_email_address` method
looks pretty much the same as the `PasswordsMailer#reset` which was generated from the Rails authentication generator.

```ruby:app/mailers/user_mailer.rb
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def verify_email_address(user)
    @user = user
    mail(subject: "Please verify your email", to: user.email_address)
  end
end
```

The view we're using is also quite similar to the one generated for the password reset. We're calling
`@user.email_address_verification_token` to generate the token which will be used to do the verification.

```ruby:app/views/user_mailer/verify_email_address.html.erb
<p>
  Please verify your email by clicking the link below:
  <%= link_to 'Verify Email', email_address_verification_url(@user.email_address_verification_token) %>
</p>
```

### Verification Controller

Continuing with the trend of following what was generated for passwords, we'll create an
`EmailAddressVerificationsController`. It is going to have two methods, `#show` to perform the verification
and `#resend` to send another email if needed.

```ruby:app/controllers/email_address_verifications_controller.rb
class EmailAddressVerificationsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find_by_email_address_verification_token(params[:token])

    if @user == Current.user
      @user.verify
      # Handle valid case: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    else
      # Handle invalid case: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
    end
  end

  def resend
    UserMailer.verify_email_address(Current.user).deliver_later
    # Handle response: render a JSON payload or redirect to another page
  end
end
```

To note, both of these methods require the user to be logged in. When we're doing the verification in `#show`,
we ensure that we can find the `User` based on the token from the email. If no `User` record is found that means
that the 24 hour window has passed and the token has expired. In that case, we'll want to return instructions to
the user to send themselves another verification email via `#resend`. In the case where we found the `User` record
and that found record is the same as the authenticated user performing the action, we'll verify the record.

### New Routes

We've added `User` creation, the ability to verify an email address, and resend a verification email.
We'll need routes to support those actions!

```ruby:config/routes.rb
  resources :users, only: [ :create ]

  resources :email_address_verifications, only: [ :show ], param: :token do
    collection do
      post "resend"
    end
  end
```

### New `User` Attribute: `verified`

We want to add a column to `User` to indicate if they've successfully verified their email address.

```ruby:db/migrate/<timestamp>_add_user_verified.rb
class AddUserVerified < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :verified, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```

In `EmailAddressVerificationsController` we made a call to `@user.verify` so we'll need to implement that method as well.

```ruby:app/models/user.rb
def verify
  update(verified: true)
end
```

While this `verified` column itself doesn't do anything right now, it can be used to redirect someone
to the verification page or prevent them from accessing certain parts of the application if `verified` is `false`.
That choice is left up to the reader but continue reading for some further exploration of how to handle users
who haven't yet verified.

### Application Access Before Verification

Part of adding in email address verification is deciding on whether or not to limit access to the application before
verification has been completed. On one hand we might want new users to jump in right away and start exploring what the
application has to offer. In this case, they are able to get a feel as to whether or not they're going to be long term
users of the application without being burdened to go to their email client and complete the verification. This approach
opens up a lot of scenarios that will have to be considered.

- What happens when the verification token expires? Is their access restricted if no token is present?
- If they request a new token after expiration do they maintain full access to the application? This means they could
  continue using the application forever without ever doing verification.
- At what point is an unverified account removed from the system? If they've been able to interact with the system and
  have data associated with their account, that will all need to be removed.
- What if someone uses an email address they don't own and then the actual owner of the email address tries to sign up?
  If there is data associated with that account, it will need to be removed before the actual owner starts using the
  application.

The answer to those questions will depend on the type of application being built. A social network, for example, likely
wouldn't want to force verification before application access. Doing so may add too much friction to finding out
whether or not someone likes the social network. If there is too much friction to getting started, the social network
might not grow fast enough. However, with an enterprise application where people are signing up and expecting to join and have
access to the same data as their colleagues, then ensuring the email address has been verified before granting access
to the application 100% the correct choice.

## Conclusion

Whew, that was a lot of words written compared to the amount of code but I quite enjoyed exploring this topic. I hope
you were able to learn something and are able to yank some, or all, of the code if you're working on adding email address
verification to your application. We'll see if any of this functionality eventually makes its way into the Rails
authentication generator. If I had to guess, I think it will!
