_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

If you haven't heard of the term Preview Environment before it may be because it goes by many different names. Some
of those names include Ephemeral Environment or Preview Deployment but they all are describing the same concept.
That concept is an isolated running instance of an application's code that is meant to be used before the code is
shipped to the production site. Let's finalize this concept with a definition from Vercel's
[Preview Deployments Overview documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments)

> Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app in a live deployment without merging those changes to
> your Git project's production branch.

A quick background on myself in regard to this topic; I've been working at [Release](https://release.com) for the past
four years and we've been championing Environments as a Service. You can think of Environments as a Service as a platform
to manage the complexities of the infrastructure needed to create Preview Environments for any company.
Before joining Release I worked at a company where I was a consumer of an internal tool that provided Preview Environments
for all the applications the company was working on.

<Aside heading="Preview Environments are not Remote Development Environments">
  While a Remote Development Environment *could* be used as Preview Environment,
  my opinion is that that Preview Environments are based on deployments tied to
  a commit rather than the possibility of ever-changing code. You wouldn't want
  someone visiting your Remote Development Environment and deleting a bunch of
  records in the database causing an unnecessary interruption to your workflow.
  Sharing a Remote Development Environment with another person is a step earlier
  than sharing a Preview Environment.
</Aside>

## What is an Environment anyway?

If you're familiar with the concept of different environments then you can skip over this section, but I wanted
to zoom out from Preview Environments and talk about the different traditional environments. We'll start at a Local
Environment and work our way up to a Production Environment.

### Local Environment

A Local Environment is the environment that runs on a desktop or laptop at home or in an office and likely differs from
production by a lot. This is where most engineers (unless they're using a Remote Development Environment) will do their
coding. Typically, resources like a database will be installed natively on the machine and connected to through a
`localhost` address.

Local Environments may also be powered by tools like [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If the company
is deploying their application through Docker images onto a container based architecture, it may make sense to use
Docker Compose to bring the setup of the Local Environment closer to the setup of the Production Environment.

### Development Environment

The Development Environment is the closest analogy to a Preview Environment we have. It is meant to be a place where
work in progress on a branch can be shared for early feedback. There may be a handful of Development Environments
available for the company to share but because they are a limited resource they can become a bottleneck. A telltale
sign of needing Preview Environments is if a company is having to schedule time slots for code to be deployed onto a
Development Environment and engineers are unable to ship their work due to having to wait for an available slot.

### QA Environment

The QA Environment is a step towards moving code that has been merged to the main branch to the Production Environment.
Generally the QA Environment will have automated end-to-end tests run against it to ensure that no regressions have
occurred as well as QA engineers testing the new features that have been merged to ensure they're meeting the acceptance
criteria.

### Staging Environment

The Staging Environment is the final step before code is shipped to the Production Environment. Most of the time,
companies will attempt to make the infrastructure surrounding the Staging Environment match as close as possible to the
Production Environment. Doing so is an attempt to catch any issues that may arise due to differing under provisioned
resources in the preceding environments.

### Production Environment

The Production Environment is the customer facing website or service. It will have the most attention paid to it by
various teams to ensure that it is working properly as close to 100% of the time as possible. It will also use the
largest amount of resources compared to any of the preceding environments. Code that makes it to the Production
Environment has gone through development, testing, and acceptance by engineers and stakeholders to ensure that it will
provide value to the customers. In the end, the Production Environment is the manifestation of the company on a website.

## Resembling Production

Preview Environments should resemble the Production Environment as closely as they possibly can. The reason for this
is to catch errors that arise from different versions of software, differences in the scale of data, or behavior that
changes when a program is switched into production mode as early as possible. While these are not the only factors that
play into ensuring a Preview Environment resembles the Production Environment, they should give us an idea of things
to look for.

### Software Versions

Ensuring that your Local, Preview, and Production Environments all share the same major version of software helps to
reduce bugs that might only be caught when new code is deployed to production. If you're using a different major version
on your Local Environment of an application which is an external dependency you might end up using a feature of that
application which isn't available to other environments. The most critical thing you can do is have the Preview Environment
use the same version of external dependencies as the Production Environment. That is a great way apply a shift-left
mentality to uncover these types of bugs. The last thing you want is for the Production Environment to crash because
it doesn't support a feature of an external dependency.

### Differences in Data Scale

In the following section we'll learn more about how to populate the data in a Preview Environment but one of the things
to be wary of is a lack of data on the Local Environment. When adding a new feature, an engineer may change a database
query by adding an additional `WHERE` clause and in doing so they unknowingly stop using an index that was relied upon.
The engineer might only have a few hundred rows in a table on their local database so the query behaves according to
their expectations. However, if the production database has millions or hundreds of millions of rows on the table then
the changes to the query are going to have significant performance implications.

Another database related issue that can arise are changes to tables causing locks. There is a Ruby gem called
[strong_migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) that will throw errors when these unsafe actions
happen during a migration. One example is [Changing the type of a column](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations/blob/a0c3cc3dc2734358a6009123050b0d2e165e9195/README.md#changing-the-type-of-a-column)

> Changing the type of a column causes the entire table to be rewritten. During this time, reads and writes are
> blocked in Postgres, and writes are blocked in MySQL and MariaDB.

Again, on the Local Environment the table may only have a few hundred rows and this lock time is minimal. There also
won't be anyone else attempting to write to the table during time of the migration so no problems would arise. These type
of problems are harder to catch and resolve but if the Preview Environment has data at a similar scale to the Production
Environment then hopefully we notice that a migration is taking a long time and start to think about what implications
that would have.

### Applications in Production Mode

The applications that we build tend to behave differently when they're set into production mode. We'll use environment
variables like `NODE_ENV` or `RAILS_ENV` to tell the application to swap into that mode and our code paths will fork
when we run checks like `Rails.env.production?`. Applications in development mode tend to have features running that
help with developer experience such as hot module reloading or un-minified code. While those are great to have when
writing code, they aren't particularly useful on a Preview Environment and they tend to slow applications down. By
putting the application into production mode, we're ensuring that the Preview Environment behaves as closely to the
Production Environment as possible.

To run the Preview Environments in production mode we'll want to introduce a second environment variable such as
`ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` where the values are `LOCAL | DEVELOPMENT | PREVIEW | QA | STAGING | PRODUCTION`. By having this
second variable, we're able to set the application into production mode but ensure that if there are certain behaviors
we don't want to include, say sending emails to customers, we can use a check like
`process.env.ENVIRONMENT_TYPE === "PRODUCTION"` to switch behaviors. Try not to place large code paths behind this check
because that could lead to bugs arising only on the Production Environment but instead use it in your configurations to
toggle off anything that could affect real customers.

## Data Requirements

A defining characteristic of a Preview Environment is its data integrity. As mentioned in the previous section, we want
the Preview Environment to resemble the Production Environment as closely as possible but providing the same data can
be a challenge. Let's explore a few options.

### No Data

A Preview Environment that starts with no data puts the onus on the engineer to manually fill in the data requirements
for the feature they're working on. While this no data approach can work, it is not an exercise that would encourage use
of Preview Environments; when the environment is finished deploying for the first time it should be ready for use,
not require additional setup.

### Seed Data

Using a seed data file which is loaded into the database during the initial deployment. Using seed data is a good
first step, but it is constrained by the amount of data written into the file, which tend to be known good datasets.
For example, there may be a certain dataset that is causing a bug on production but is not replicated in the seed
data making it impossible to test without manually adjusting the data. Another issue that can arise with seed data is
a difference in the amount of data; if the seed data only contains say 100 rows on a table it may not be possible to
test whether a new SQL query will perform adequately when run on the Production Environment. These issues are not to
say that a seed data approach won't work, in most cases it can be enough to make the Preview Environment useful,
but there are a few more options.

### Database Backup and Restore

All databases attached to permanent environments like the Staging or Production Environment will be using a database
which has nightly, or even hourly, backups enabled. Having the backups ensures that if anything were to go wrong with
that environment, it can be recreated from a point in time without much data loss. Using one of these backups as the
starting point for our Preview Environment ensures that it resembles characteristics exhibited by the Production
Environment. Using the backup from the Production Environment is great from a data integrity standpoint because any
bugs happening to real customers due to certain data configurations can be caught. However, using the production data
leads to issues such as customer PII being accessible to anyone with access to the Preview Environment, which is a
very large security risk. Instead, we can use the backup from the Staging Environment which will have enough data to
make the Preview Environment immediately useful.

### Masked Production Data

The last option, which is the most complicated, but yields the best results is to use the database backup from the
Production Environment and apply a [data masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_masking) approach. We won't go into any great detail on how set this
up here, but the general idea would be to create a new database which is restored from a production backup. Once
the new database is available, mask all the data, which is far easier said than done. After the masking is complete,
create a new backup from that database. Finally, make the new masked backup available for use by the Preview
Environments. There are companies who offer this data masking a service so it is possible to pay for this service
instead of having to create and maintain the process. The result of the data masking work would be a dataset that does
not contain any PII and has all the records and associations available to debug complex bugs.

## Automation

Now that we understand a lot more about what a Preview Environment is, we need to touch on how we create them. Every
company, team, and application is going to have different requirements needed for the Preview Environment and that is
far too broad of a topic us to attempt to cover here. However, I want to introduce the concept of the Golden Path.
From the Spotify article [How We Use Golden Paths to Solve Fragmentation in Our Software Ecosystem](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/)
we can use their definition.

> The Golden Path — as we define it today — is the ‘opinionated and supported’ path to ‘build something’ (for example,
> build a backend service, put up a website, create a data pipeline). The Golden Path tutorial is a step-by-step
> tutorial that walks you through this opinionated and supported path.

This means that for a given need, say a backend service in Java, a set of requirements has been designed and implemented
to ensure that any team who needs such a service does not have to start from scratch. Given a Golden Path to follow, the
team only needs to add their own application code along with defining any external dependencies and they can create a
Preview Environment. Building this automation through the Golden Path is no easy task, but for consumers who only
want a Preview Environment, it should be as easy as possible to get one.

### Single (Click | Command) Deploy

Every team should have the ability to create a Preview Environment with a single click or command. That click would
be in the form of an internal or SaaS web application that has been set up along a Golden path with the team's
application code. When an individual engineer wants to create a Preview Environment they should only need to visit
the web page to create one, indicate which git branch they're using and click deploy. The same idea could also be
available through a CLI. In this case there would be a configuration file that indicates what the application
is and the CLI can infer the git branch so the engineer need only issue a command like
`$ cli-tool create-preview-environment`.

### Pull Requests

Taking the automation a step further where no manual interaction is needed, it is a smart idea to create a Preview
Environment when a Pull Request is opened or a specific label is applied to it. To achieve this you'll need to have the
creation of your Preview Environment running on something like GitHub Actions or a web service that is listening for
webhooks. Removing any friction to creating Preview Environments is a great way to onboard people who have never used
them before as well.

## Shareable

Finally, Preview Environments need to be shareable; previewing is more fun when others are involved! Each Preview
Environment should have a unique URL that ensures that it won't ever collide with another environment. For example, on
Vercel the unique URL looks like `jeremykreutzbender-idq0kqlt6-jerks-projects.vercel.app` where `idq0kqlt6` is the
unique portion. In addition to that unique URL, there might be a more user-friendly URL. Again on Vercel, that would
look like `jeremykreutzbender-com-git-main-jerks-projects.vercel.app` where they have added the Git branch name meaning
any time I push a new branch for this website, I could replace `main` with my branch name and find the new Preview
Environment. If the application consists of more than one service, we'll need to adjust the URL to contain the service
name. We may end up with something like `frontend-jeremykreutzbender-idq0kqlt6-jerks-projects.domain.com` and
`backend-jeremykreutzbender-idq0kqlt6-jerks-projects.domain.com`.

## Real World Use Cases

The number of ways that Preview Environments can be used is going to depend on the size and makeup of the organization.
Are the engineers bottle-necked by a limited number of Development Environments? Is the QA team struggling because bugs
are being found after code is merged to main? Are stakeholders unhappy when a feature is marked as completed but the
first time they see the feature, which doesn't meet their expectation, on the Production Environment? Let's cover a few
use cases that I've encountered.

### Sales Demo

Sales teams which need a way to demo the product they're selling without stepping on the toes of others on the
team benefit immensely from Preview Environments. Instead of using the Preview Environment to see new features early,
they'll be relying on the fact that they can create a replica of their service from the main branch that is isolated
from everyone else during the demo. There may even be a special database backup that can be selected for these sales
demos which provides all the needed underlying data, but also a clean slate to demonstrate the onboarding process for
new customers. The sales team member will also be able to perform any destructive actions, such as removing team members
from an organization without fear of causing issues for someone else. Once the demo is over, the Preview Environment
can be destroyed and the sales team member can prepare for the next call without needing to do any additional data
cleanup.

### QA Testing

We previously talked about the QA Environment as code travels to the Production Environment but an important use case in
getting code approved to merge is QA approval. When a QA engineer needs to go through their testing process, being able
to create their own Preview Environment, which has its own isolated data, ensures that they're starting their testing
from a clean slate. This is also a perfect opportunity for testing code which deletes records from the database as those
deletions won't affect anyone else. Better yet, if the code changes fail to pass the testing but the record deletion
happened, a new Preview Environment can be created to restart the process!

### Stakeholder Approval

For any stakeholders on a given task, Preview Environments are a huge step forward in being able to verify that the
changes being made are in line with the expectations. Rather than having to send over screenshots and hope that suffices,
stakeholders can be sent the link to the Preview Environment and verify themselves. This ability for stakeholders to
interactively see the changes ensures that their expectations are being met. They can then give direct feedback if
any changes are needed.

Vercel took this concept of direct feedback to the next level with their Preview Environment
[Comments](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments) feature. It allows the stakeholder to give feedback
directly in the UI rather than having to take and annotate screenshots and then send them over to the engineering team.
Adding user experience improvements like comments goes a long way in making Preview Environments a sticky feature that
organizations can't live without.

## Conclusion

After all that, hopefully the answer to the question 'What Are Preview Environments?' has been answered. There are lots
of benefits to adopting Preview Environments but it is not an easy task to accomplish. It will likely take a dedicated
DevOps team to build the scripts and pipelines to needed or an even larger project to create an Internal Developer
Platform. There are open source solutions that will lighten the load for this type of effort and remove the need to
start from scratch. Many companies are also offering SaaS solutions for Preview Environments but we aren't going to
open a new can of worms with a build vs buy debate in the conclusion section. Let's appreciate the fact that there
are many different ways to solve this issue and hopefully you're able to adopt one to start using Preview Environments.
