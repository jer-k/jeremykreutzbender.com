Another caveat to using [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/) is that we can make changes to our objects directly from the UI.
This means that these changes will never flow through our ActiveRecord Models and we won't have access to callbacks
like `before_save`; that presents a bit of a divergence from the typical Rails way of making data changes in code. An example
from the project I've been working on is that my `User` table has `first_name` and `last_name` columns as well as a `full_name`
column. I wanted `full_name` to be a compound of `first_name` and `last_name` so let's walk through some different ways that
can be achieved, first by using a `before_save` callback, second using PostgreSQL
[Generated Columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html), and finally creating a
[PostgreSQL Function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html) using the
[fx](https://github.com/teoljungberg/fx) gem.

## `before_save` Example

To set the stage of what we're trying to accomplish, let's start out with an example using `before_save`. This should
look very familiar to everyone.

```ruby:app/models/user.rb
before_save :set_full_name

private

def set_full_name
  assign_attributes(full_name: first_name + last_name)
end
```

This approach is simple and effective and works great if every data change always flows through our `User` model. However,
if someone where to connect to the database directly and issue the following command then our `full_name` column would
be out of sync.

```sql
UPDATE users SET first_name = 'Blog' WHERE id = '1';
```

It's unlikely that someone is going to use this manual approach to update data, but there is a chance! However, we want to use
Zero and this is exactly how Zero will update the data. Next, let's look at an example where we defer computing `full_name`
to the database itself.

## PostgreSQL Generated Column Example

From the Generated Columns documentation linked above we can see that a generated column is an option for our task.

> A generated column is a special column that is always computed from other columns. Thus, it is for columns what a view
> is for tables. There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. A stored generated column is computed when
> it is written (inserted or updated) and occupies storage as if it were a normal column. A virtual generated column
> occupies no storage and is computed when it is read. Thus, a virtual generated column is similar to a view and a
> stored generated column is similar to a materialized view (except that it is always updated automatically).
> PostgreSQL currently implements only stored generated columns.

Rails supports adding stored columns through migrations as a keyword argument. Let's go ahead and create one
to understand how it works.

```ruby:db/migrate/<timestamp>_add_generated_full_name.rb
class AddGeneratedFullName < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :full_name, :string,
      as: "first_name || ' ' || last_name",
      stored: true,
      null: false
  end
end
```

Now when we create or update a row on the `users` table, whether we're using our `User` model or applying changes
directly with SQL statements, we can be sure that the `full_name` column will properly be set. We would hope
this article ends here as this approach is very succint and accomplishes our task, unfortunately there is a very
problem when pairing this with Zero. At the very bottom of the Generated Columns documentation, there is this
statement.

> Generated columns are skipped for logical replication and cannot be specified in a CREATE PUBLICATION column list.

That is a big issue because the logical replication is how Zero extracts data from our primary database. I'm not
entirely sure why this isn't possible but if you Google
[why aren't generated columns replicated in postgresql](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+aren%27t+generated+columns+replicated+in+postgresql&oq=why+aren%27t+generated+columns+replicated+in+postgresql&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigAdIBCDY0MzRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
you can see that there are many people who have asked the same question. With that knowledge, let's move
on to our final example of how to accomplish our task.

## `fx` Gem Example

Our final example is using the `fx` gem. From the README, we can see it helps us with managing
functions and triggers via migrations.

> F(x) adds methods to ActiveRecord::Migration to create and manage database functions and triggers in Rails.

Let's explore how we can use it to accomplish generating our `full_name` column. We start by adding the `fx` gem
and using it to generate a migration and function `.sql` file.

```ruby:Gemfile
gem "fx"
```

```bash
$ rails generate fx:function generate_full_name
```

The migration will be filled in for us by `fx` and ready to use.

```ruby:db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_function_generate_full_name.rb
class CreateFunctionGenerateFullName < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_function :generate_full_name
  end
end
```

However the `.sql` file will be completely empty; I've gone ahead and written the function.

```sql:db/functions/generate_full_name_v01.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_full_name()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.full_name = TRIM(CONCAT(NEW.first_name, ' ', NEW.last_name));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

`generate_full_name` is a generic function that will concatenate the `first_name` and `last_name` columns
into a `full_name` column that can be used on any table. This function currently isn't being used though, we need
to create a [trigger function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-trigger.html) to set it up for use
on the `users` table. `fx` provides this functionality as well.

```bash
$ rails generate fx:trigger users_full_name table_name:users
```

Again, the migration will be filled in for us by `fx` and ready to use.

```ruby:db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_trigger_users_full_name.rb
class CreateTriggerUsersFullName < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def up
    create_trigger :set_users_full_name, on: :users
  end
end
```

The `.sql` file will again be empty. I've gone ahead and filled it with a trigger function that will call the
`generate_full_name` function anytime we create a new row on the `users` table or we update the `first_name` or
`last_name` column of an existing row.

```sql:db/triggers/set_users_full_name_v01.sql
CREATE TRIGGER set_users_full_name BEFORE INSERT
OR
UPDATE OF first_name, last_name
ON users FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION generate_full_name();
```

This approach took a few more steps and a bit more code, but `fx` did a lot of the heavy lifting. Remember
that all this code can now be checked in under version control so that it is easy to view and maintain moving
forward. Best of all, functions and triggers are fully supported by Zero so this is my suggested solution
to solving this problem!

## `fx` Function Updates and Versioning

Having version controlled database functions is why `fx` is so valuable. If you noticed the filenames created for the
functions in the last section, they ended with `v01.sql`. `fx` has functionality to create updates to those functions
where a `v02.sql` file will be generated as well as a migration to update the database to use the newer version of the
function. Refer to the section of the README,
[Cool, but what if I need to change a trigger or function?](https://github.com/teoljungberg/fx?tab=readme-ov-file#cool-but-what-if-i-need-to-change-a-trigger-or-function)
to learn more. I wanted to highlight this feature because it makes managing the lifecycle of the functions so much
easier when all the changes can be seen in code and reviewed by colleagues.

## Zero Custom Mutators

At the time of writing this, custom mutators have not shipped, but the premise behind them is that Zero will
optimistically update the UI with any changes and then send an API call with the change payload to our application
server. In theory this means that the UI will update immediately and then we'll actually write the data into the
database through our ActiveRecord Model, allowing for use of a `before_save` callback. For our `full_name` column,
I could see writing a custom mutator for a `User` profile page where they're allowed to edit their name and avoiding
the PostgreSQL functions all together. The upside of this functionality is it gives us application developers multiple
options to solve the same problem, which is always a good thing. The downside is that if you allow a `User` to update
their name in multiple locations, you'll have to remember to use a custom mutator each time.

If you want to read more about custom mutators, check out this
[Introducting Zero](https://replicache.notion.site/Introducing-Zero-8ce1b1f184aa4a9088a9f76e1b8db003) document and
search for the 'Custom Mutators' section.

## Conclusion

I hope this helped shed on light on a new approach to managing data requirements when we have deviate from using ActiveRecord
callbacks. I'm pretty excited for this workflow of managing the functions with the `fx` gem and I'm already starting to plan
out how to build an audit log, similar to the [paper_trail](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail) gem. I'll get a
post written up about that work once it has been completed.
