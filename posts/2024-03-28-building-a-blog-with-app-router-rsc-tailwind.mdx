_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

As 2024 started I finally got around to working on the blog portion of this site. While I was having a lot of fun
building out the other pages
(see [Building a new website with Next.js 14 and App Router](https://jeremykreutzbender.com/blog/building-a-new-website-with-nextjs))
I knew that I needed to get to work on the blog portion so that I could write about all the work I had been doing!
Thankfully I wasn't starting this endeavour from scratch as [@max_leiter](https://twitter.com/max_leiter), who works
at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) had written an extremely thorough tutorial on how to do this. I encourage you to read
[Building a blog with Next.js 14 and React Server Components](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13) as
he goes into far more detail on all the steps needed to start from scratch. I didn't want to recreate Max's blog post so
what I'm presenting here are some of the changes I made.

## [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I've been building my site using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), which leverages Tailwind so I figured I
would stick with this approach when building out the blog portion as well. I discovered that Tailwind has a
[typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#typography) plugin which adds the `prose` class.

> The @tailwindcss/typography plugin adds a set of prose classes that can be used to quickly add sensible typographic
> styles to content blocks that come from sources like markdown or a CMS database.

This is exactly what I wanted and using [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups)
allowed me to wrap all the content in the blog and any other page I want to render with Markdown in the `prose` class.

You can look at my [layout.tsx](<https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/app/(site)/(content)/layout.tsx>)
but the contents are shown below.

```tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export default function ContentLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="md:w-full md:flex md:justify-center">
      <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

There is functionality for dark mode as well with `dark:prose-invert`! With this layout in place I was extremely happy
to not worry about anymore styling for any of my content pages.

## No next-mdx-remote

In Max's [Fetching and rendering markdown](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13#fetching-and-rendering-markdown)
section of his blog, he mentions that he wants to use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
_for niche specific reasons_. I don't have any reasoning to do that, so I wanted to change the approach and ensure that
all my Markdown files are rendered the same way. What I mean by that is a regular `.mdx` file can be rendered as a page
component and the [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#getting-started)
section of Markdown and MDX documentation for Next.js shows how this is done. Instead of passing the plugins and the
contents of the `mdx-components.tsx` file to `next-mdx-remote`, I want to leverage the `createMdx` functionality described
in the Getting Started tutorial above. I'll cover my changes to `createMdx` and `mdx-components.tsx` in the next
section.

My [fetchPosts.ts](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/lib/fetchPosts.ts) differs a bit from
how Max set his up. Lets go through the changes that allowed me to stop using `next-mdx-remote`.
First up is `parseMdxFiles`.

```ts
async function parseMdxFiles() {
  const filePaths = await fs.readdir("./posts/");

  const postsData = [];

  for (const filePath of filePaths) {
    const postFilePath = `./posts/${filePath}`;
    const postContent = await fs.readFile(postFilePath, "utf8");
    const { data } = matter(postContent);

    if (!data.draft) {
      const postData = { ...data, content: postContent } as Post;
      postsData.push(postData);
    }
  }

  return postsData;
}

const parsedMdxFiles = cache(parseMdxFiles);
```

In `parseMdxFiles` we're reading the checked in blog posts at [./posts](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/tree/main/posts)
and constructing an array of `Post` objects. Those objects contain the frontmatter, which is extracted using
[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and the actual post content. We're also using the new
[cache](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) feature from React create `parsedMdxFiles` to ensure that we only ever
have to parse these files once, which is what we want because we're going to reference them a few more times.

The next function is `postComponents`.

```ts
export async function postComponents() {
  const components: Record<string, () => ReactElement> = {};

  const postsData = await parsedMdxFiles();

  for (const post of postsData) {
    const { default: Component } = await import(
      `@/posts/${post.date}-${post.slug}.mdx`
    );
    components[post.slug] = Component;
  }

  return components;
}
```

Here we're using our cached `parsedMdxFiles` and building up a hash of React components, which are the rendered
content of each Markdown file. Since we're in the world of React Server Components, we don't need to do any sort of
[Lazy Loading](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) as the docs state

> Lazy loading applies to Client Components.

Instead, we can use `await import` as a way to dynamically load each component. It took me a long time to come to this
conclusion and I nearly gave up; I was going to manually import each blog post after trying to use `React.lazy`
and `next/dynamic` to achieve this, but I was happy to finally come to the realization I can just `await import`.
We can then use this function in
[slug/page.tsx](<https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/app/(site)/(content)/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page.tsx>)
as so.

```tsx
export default async function BlogPost({
  params: { slug },
}: BlogPostPageParams) {
  const components = await postComponents();
  const postComponent = components[slug];

  if (!postComponent) return notFound();
  return postComponent();
}
```

With that, I was able to get the blog posts rendering without the use of `next-mdx-remote`.

## My createMDX and mdx-components.tsx Setup

Now that the blog posts are rendering, I wanted to add some rehype plugins to give a little extra functionality to
each post. I added [rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) and
[rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) so that I could create linkable
header elements. In the end my `createMdx` in
[next.config.mjs](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/next.config.mjs) function looked like this

```ts
const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkFrontmatter,
      [remarkMdxFrontmatter, { name: "frontmatter" }],
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug, rehypeAutolinkHeadings],
  },
});
```

The next step was to create a nice clickable header that would be rendered. I decided `<h2>` would be where I would
start with this and if I wanted to add more clickable elements I could expand later. I created an
[H2WithAnchor](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/components/mdx/h2-with-anchor.tsx) component
that looks like this.

```tsx
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

type Props = {
  id?: string;
} & PropsWithChildren;
export function H2WithAnchor({ id, children }: Props) {
  return (
    <h2 className="group" id={id}>
      {children}
      <a
        aria-label={id}
        href={`#${id}`}
        className="p-2 italic font-bold opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-75"
      >
        #
      </a>
    </h2>
  );
}
```

Then I added it to my [mdx-components.tsx](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/mdx-components.tsx).

```tsx
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // ...
  h2: ({ id, children }) => <H2WithAnchor id={id}>{children}</H2WithAnchor>,
  // ...
};
```

Now there is a nice `#` that appears when hovering over the `<h2>` elements and will change the route to be anchored
on the heading. You can click on
[building-a-blog-with-app-router-rsc-tailwind#my-createmdx-and-mdx-componentstsx-setup](http://jeremykreutzbender.com/blog/building-a-blog-with-app-router-rsc-tailwind#my-createmdx-and-mdx-componentstsx-setup)
to land right back here!

I've added a handful of other components into the `mdx-components.tsx` file and am really liking the ability to mix
React into my preferred way of writing.

## Nitpicking Bright's Code Highlighting

Part of Max's tutorial was choosing [bright](https://github.com/code-hike/bright) as the code highlighting solution. It
was extremely easy to set up and with a variety of different themes, I was able to find one that I really liked and
matched the color scheme on my site pretty closely. I chose `solarized`, which I found from the
[Code Hike Themes](https://codehike.org/docs/themes) page.

One of my favorite things to do when writing Markdown files is to use the `backticks` to highlight inline code. However,
I noticed that the current implementation was not actually applying any styling and I was ending up with words that
looked like &grave;this&grave;. I looked at the HTML that was being rendered and it was a `<code>` tag so I figured I
could update my `mdx-components.tsx` file to have something like

```js
code: ({ children }) => <div className="bg-blue-50">{children}</div>;
```

and see the changes. Instead I was presented with this nice error message

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'children')

Call Stack
children
node_modules/bright/dist/index.mjs (516:44)

```

I did some investigation and eventually opened a ticket
[Attempting to adjust 'code' in mdx-components breaks](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/issues/37). I followed up
[two days later](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/issues/37#issuecomment-1896152229) with a re-creation and potential
solution to the issue. Unfortunately minutes after posting that comment my house was struck with a weather related
catastrophe and I completely forgot about attempting to create a PR to remedy the issue. Much to my surprise,
a few months later [@joshwcomeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau), whom I follow on Twitter, opened a PR referencing
the issue I created. He was experiencing the same thing and wanted to be able to utilize adding styling for his React
course [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) (you should check it out, he'll teach you to build a blog as well!)
The maintainer of the project, [@pomber](https://twitter.com/pomber), came in, tidied up the code a bit more, and we
had ourselves a new [0.8.5](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/releases/tag/bright%400.8.5) release of `bright`!

Needless to say, my original code changes I detailed in the issue weren't anywhere close to what was merged, I was
overjoyed to be a part of open source collaboration. Having multiple people are able to come together to improve
software that we all enjoy using is an awesome experience. Now I can `highlight` as `much` as `I want to`!

## Conclusion

I learned a lot while putting all this together and I'm really happy with the results. For now, I've got everything
in a place where I won't need to spend any more time working on setting up the blog and I can focus on writing more
content!
