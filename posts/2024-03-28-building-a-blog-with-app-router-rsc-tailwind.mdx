_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

As 2024 started I finally got around to working on the blog portion of this site. While I was having a lot of fun
building out the other pages
(see [Building a new website with Next.js 14 and App Router](https://jeremykreutzbender.com/blog/building-a-new-website-with-nextjs))
I knew that I needed to get to work on the blog portion so that I could write about all the work I had been doing!
Thankfully I wasn't starting this endeavour from scratch as [@max_leiter](https://twitter.com/max_leiter), who works
at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) had written an extremely thorough tutorial on how to do this. I encourage you to read
[Building a blog with Next.js 14 and React Server Components](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13) as
he goes into far more detail on all the steps needed to start from scratch. I didn't want to recreate Max's blog post so
what I'm presenting here are some of the changes I made.

## [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I've been building my site using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), which leverages Tailwind so I figured I
would stick with this approach when building out the blog portion as well. I discovered that Tailwind has a
[typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#typography) plugin which adds the `prose` class.

> The @tailwindcss/typography plugin adds a set of prose classes that can be used to quickly add sensible typographic
> styles to content blocks that come from sources like markdown or a CMS database.

This is exactly what I wanted and using [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups)
allowed me to wrap all the content in the blog and any other page I want to render with Markdown in the `prose` class.

You can look at my [layout.tsx](<https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/app/(site)/(content)/layout.tsx>)
but the contents are shown below.

```tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export default function ContentLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="md:w-full md:flex md:justify-center">
      <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

There is functionality for dark mode as well with `dark:prose-invert`! With this layout in place I was extremely happy
to not worry about anymore styling for any of my content pages.

## No next-mdx-remote!

In Max's [Fetching and rendering markdown](https://maxleiter.com/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13#fetching-and-rendering-markdown)
section of his blog, he mentions that he wants to use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
_for niche specific reasons_. I don't have any reasoning to do that so I wanted to change the approach and ensure that
all my Markdown is all rendered the same way. What I mean by that is a regular `.mdx` file can be rendered as a page
component, the [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#getting-started)
section of Markdown and MDX documentation for Next.js shows how this is done. Since I enjoy writing content in Markdown
and I have other pages on this site, such as About which are written in Markdown, I wanted the blog posts as well as
those pages to all be rendered using the `mdx-components.tsx`. Given all that, let's dive into some changes.

My [fetchPosts.ts](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/lib/fetchPosts.ts) differs a bit from
how Max set his up so we'll go through the changes that allowed me to stop using `next-mdx-remote`.
First up is `parseMdxFiles`.

```ts
async function parseMdxFiles() {
  const filePaths = await fs.readdir("./posts/");

  const postsData = [];

  for (const filePath of filePaths) {
    const postFilePath = `./posts/${filePath}`;
    const postContent = await fs.readFile(postFilePath, "utf8");
    const { data } = matter(postContent);

    if (!data.draft) {
      const postData = { ...data, content: postContent } as Post;
      postsData.push(postData);
    }
  }

  return postsData;
}

const parsedMdxFiles = cache(parseMdxFiles);
```

In `parseMdxFiles` we're reading the checked in blog posts at [./posts](https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/tree/main/posts)
and constructing an array of `Post` objects which contain the frontmatter, which is extracted using
[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and the actual post content. We're also using the new
[cache](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) feature from React create `parsedMdxFiles` to ensure that we only ever
have to parse these files once, which is what we want because we're going to reference them a few more times.

The next function is `postComponents`.

```ts
export async function postComponents() {
  const components: Record<string, () => ReactElement> = {};

  const postsData = await parsedMdxFiles();

  for (const post of postsData) {
    const { default: Component } = await import(
      `@/posts/${post.date}-${post.slug}.mdx`
    );
    components[post.slug] = Component;
  }

  return components;
}
```

Here we're using our cached `parsedMdxFiles` and are going to build up a hash of React components, which are the rendered
content of each Markdown file. Since we're in the world of React Server Components, we don't need to do any sort of
[Lazy Loading](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) as the docs state

> Lazy loading applies to Client Components.

Instead, we can use `await import` as a way to dynamically load each component. It took me a long time to come to this
conclusion and I nearly gave up and was going to manually import each blog post after trying to use `React.lazy`
and `next/dynamic` to achieve this, but I was happy to finally come to this realization. We can then use this function
in [slug/page.tsx](<https://github.com/jer-k/jeremykreutzbender.com/blob/main/app/(site)/(content)/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page.tsx>)
as so.

```tsx
export default async function BlogPost({
  params: { slug },
}: BlogPostPageParams) {
  const post = await fetchPost(slug);

  if (!post) return notFound();

  const components = await postComponents();
  return components[slug]();
}
```

With that, I was able to get the blog posts rendering without the use of `next-mdx-remote`.If you have any questions
about this approach or if I did something that is completely crazy, feel free to reach out on the Contact page because
I would love to discuss this more!

## Nitpicking Bright's Code Highlighting

Part of Max's tutorial was choosing [bright](https://github.com/code-hike/bright) as the code highlighting solution. It
was extremely easy to set up and with a variety of different themes, I was able to find one that I really liked and
matched the color scheme on my site pretty closely. I chose `solarized`, which I found from the
[Code Hike Themes](https://codehike.org/docs/themes) page.

One of my favorite things to do when writing Markdown files is to use the `backticks` to highlight inline code. However,
I noticed that the current implementation was not actually applying any styling and I was ending up with words that
looked like &grave;this&grave;. I looked at the HTML that was being rendered and it was a `<code>` tag so I figured I
could update my `mdx-components.tsx` file to have something like

```js
code: ({ children }) => <div className="bg-blue-50">{children}</div>;
```

and see the changes. Instead I was presented with this nice error message

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'children')

Call Stack
children
node_modules/bright/dist/index.mjs (516:44)

```

I did some investigation and eventually opened a ticket
[Attempting to adjust 'code' in mdx-components breaks](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/issues/37). I followed up
[two days later](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/issues/37#issuecomment-1896152229) with a re-creation and potential
solution to the issue. Unfortunately minutes after posting that comment my house was struck with a weather related
catastrophe and I completely forgot about attempting to create a PR to remedy the issue. Much to my surprise,
a few months later [@joshwcomeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau), whom I follow on Twitter, opened a PR referencing
the issue I created. He was experiencing the same thing and wanted to be able to utilize adding styling for his React
course [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) (you should check it out, he'll teach you to build a blog as well!)
The maintainer of the project, [@pomber](https://twitter.com/pomber), came in, tidied up the code a bit more, and we
had ourselves a new [0.8.5](https://github.com/code-hike/bright/releases/tag/bright%400.8.5) release of `bright`!

Needless to say, my original code changes I detailed in the issue weren't anywhere close to what was merged, I was
overjoyed to be a part of open source collaboration. Having multiple people are able to come together to improve
software that we all enjoy using is an awesome experience. Now I can `highlight` as `much` as `I want to`!

## Conclusion

I learned a lot while putting all this together and I'm really happy with the results. The speed at which the blog
posts load is crazy fast so there is no waiting around to get to reading.
