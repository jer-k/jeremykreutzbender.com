_Published on {frontmatter.date}_

At Release, we’ve been using BuildKit to do our own builds for some time now and BuildKit does an awesome job
of caching Docker image layers! But one thing that continued to slow down our builds was running `bundle install`
when upgrading gems in our Rails application. I decided to start researching if there was any way that we could
cache our `bundle install` commands over many builds because a cold `bundle install` is very slow, but incremental
changes are quite fast. In my search, I came across a KubeCon video about BuildKit,
[Running Cache-Efficient Builds at Scale on Kubernetes with BuildKit - Gautier Delorme, Apple Inc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTENRhYt3mw)
which had a very interesting slide.

This is exactly the type of solution I was looking for and it comes built in with BuildKit! Let’s take a look at
an example from the mount cache documentation to start.

Example: cache Go packages

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM golang
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
    go build ...
```

In this example, the `go build` command uses the `/root/.cache/go-build directory` to store the packages in between
builds. Because the output of go build is a binary and does not require anything to run besides that binary, this
example makes correct use of the cache. If we think of the cache directory as a named volume from the host server
into the container we can create a picture of how this example works. When `go build` is run, the cache directory
is populated on the host server and the resulting binary ends up in the container. The problem is that this mount
cache functionality wasn’t built with the idea that the packages in the cache needed to be pulled into the resulting
image.

To solve this problem I continued my search and came across this issue on the BuildKit repository,
[Am I misunderstanding RUN mount=type=cache?](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1173). The writer of the issue
explains how this functionality isn’t working with `bundle install` and is trying to figure out what to do. In one
of the answers a link to blog post in Japanese is provided,
[Dockerfile for Rails6のベストプラクティスを解説](https://qiita.com/k_kind/items/836bc7ba2e33dc2ed3e7). A Dockerfile is
provided in the post, which has the solution we’ve been searching for.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
…
RUN bundle config set app_config .bundle
RUN bundle config set path .cache/bundle
# mount cacheを利用する
RUN --mount=type=cache,uid=1000,target=/app/.cache/bundle \
    bundle install && \
    mkdir -p vendor && \
    cp -ar .cache/bundle vendor/bundle
RUN bundle config set path vendor/bundle
```

Now that we know what the solution is, let’s go through it line by line to make sure we fully understand what is
happening.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

First, we set the working directory for the Dockerfile to `/app`.

```dockerfile
RUN bundle config set path .cache/bundle
```

Then, we set Bundler’s path `.cache/bundle` which is the directory the gems will be installed into.

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,uid=1000,target=/app/.cache/bundle \
    bundle install && \
    mkdir -p vendor && \
    cp -ar .cache/bundle vendor/bundle
```

Now the important part! We use the `--mount=type=cache` and set the cache to be the same location as Bundler’s path.
But a key here is to include the `WORKDIR` path so it becomes `target=/app/.cache/bundler`. This means our directory
of installed gems will be persisted from build to build. We run `bundle install` to install the gems and then create
a vendor directory. The last step here is to copy `.cache/bundle` into `vendor/bundle` because, if you recall from the
Go example, the contents of the cache are not included in the layer.

```dockerfile
RUN bundle config set path vendor/bundle
```

Finally we set Bundler’s path to the directory we copied the files into and we’re good to go. Now we fully understand what
is happening! To wrap up, there are a few final points to cover. The first is that the code above is not quite ideal.
It works, but it is missing a few options to add some safety and reliability. There will be a full example shown below.

The mount cache accepts an `id` as a parameter. The [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run---mounttypecache)
says:

> Optional ID to identify separate/different caches. Defaults to the value of the target

Setting an `id` is valuable if there are potentially lots of Dockerfiles running on the same BuildKit server that might be
attempting to use the same cache location; imagine if two different Rails projects started sharing the same directory! Which
leads us to the second parameter of `sharing`. The [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run---mounttypecache)
says:

> One of shared, private, or locked. Defaults to shared. A shared cache mount can be used concurrently by multiple writers.
> private creates a new mount if there are multiple writers. locked pauses the second writer until the first one releases the
> mount.

We want to opt for `sharing=locked` meaning that if two builds of the same Dockerfile are running at the same time,
only one can access the cache at a time. This ensures that the output of `bundle install` won’t be mangled when the
`cp` command is issued.

An updated solution would look like this

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app/
RUN gem install Bundler
RUN bundle config set app_config .bundle
RUN bundle config set path .cache/bundle
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=<your-app-name>-gem-cache,sharing=locked,target=/app/.cache/bundle \
bundle install && \
  mkdir -p vendor && \
  cp -ar .cache/bundle vendor/bundle
RUN bundle config set path vendor/bundle
```

If you would like to read more about how the caching works, there is an issue on the BuildKit repository,
[mount=type=cache more in-depth explanation?](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1673) that has a great discussion
on how this functionality actually works.
