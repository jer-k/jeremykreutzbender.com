I've been wanting to figure out how to access the route parameters in a Next.js App Router project for a while and
I recently came by this tweet from [@fredkisss](https://twitter.com/fredkisss) pointing to a Pull Request that
had just landed in Next.js.

<Tweet id="1784357070008955083" />

The Pull Request he linked is [support breadcrumb style catch-all parallel routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65063)
by [ztanner](https://github.com/ztanner), a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) employee and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
maintainer.

The Pull Request added functionality and demonstrates how to use the [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes)
feature to access the route parameters. I would encourage you to read through that documentation to get a better
understanding of what Parallel Routes are but I will also summarize concepts as I write this out.

<Aside heading="The catch-all feature is currently in the canary">
  As of publishing (2024-04-30) the code from the Pull Request is still in the
  canary releases of Next.js. If you want to use it, you'll have to explicitly
  update your version of Next to the latest canary, which can be found at
  [https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases).
  I will update this note when it has landed in a proper release.

## Parallel Route Slots

To start on building our breadcrumbs we have to understand what slots are in Parallel Routes.
[slots](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#slots) are defined as

> Parallel routes are created using named slots. Slots are defined with the @folder convention.
> ... Slots are passed as props to the shared parent layout.

What this means is that we can add a folder to our project named `app/@breadcrumbs` to create a slot. To be able to
build out our breadcrumbs, we'll want to use a [catch-all segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)
such as `app/@breadcrumbs/[...catchAll]`. Finally, we'll add a page which will render the breadcrumbs
`app/@breadcrumbs/[...catchAll]/page.tsx`. For now, let's add a little placeholder until we're ready to build our
breadcrumbs.

```typescript jsx
type Props = {
  params: {
    catchAll: string[]
  }
}
export default function BreadcrumbsSlot({params: { catchAll } }: Props) {
  console.log("rendering in @breadcrumbs", catchAll)
  return <div>placeholder</div>
}
```

The logging statement will print out the array of route parameters that have been found.

### default.tsx

A note when using Parallel Routes is that a [default](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#defaultjs)
file is required. The docs say

> On refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, a 404 is rendered instead.

We don't want to render a 404 page so we need to add `app/@breadcrumbs/default.tsx`. In this case we're going to render
an empty fragment to satisfy the requirements.

```typescript jsx
export default function Default() {
  return (<></>)
}
```

### layout.tsx

Rendering the slot is covered more extensively in the Parallel Routes documentation linked above but a way to think
about it is that `children` is a special slot that is automatically provided. To add our defined slots, we can mimic
the way `children` are passed into the layout. We'll change our root layout at `app/layout.tsx`.

```typescript jsx
export default function Layout({ children, breadcrumbs }: { children: ReactNode, breadcrumbs: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {breadcrumbs}
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Nested Dynamic Routes

The Pull Request I referenced at the start added the functionality for deeply nested dynamic routes to work with
Parallel Routes so let's add in some routes to test this feature out. Let's go with names and add
`app/[first]/[middle]/[last]/page.tsx`. We don't need to add anything to this page so we'll return a simple message
to indicate where we're at.

```typescript jsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>Hello from Nested Dynamic</div>
  )
}
```

With this route in place, we can visit `http://localhost:3000/Joseph/Francis/Tribbiani` and we'll see
`rendering in @breadcrumbs [ 'Joseph', 'Francis', 'Tribbiani' ]` logged from the server. This is great and we'll
be able to build our breadcrumbs for this page.

## Static + Dynamic Routes

One thing I discovered while writing this post is that the catch-all does not cover routes which have static routes in
them. I wanted to add this section in because this website does not have a set of deeply nested dynamic routes, instead
I have a `blog/` route with a single dynamic route `[slug]` underneath it and I was hoping to use this feature to add
additional navigation. To demonstrate this, we can add `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`.

```typescript jsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>Hello from Blog Slug</div>
  )
}
```

If we visit `http://localhost:3000/blog/new-blog-post` we'll see `rendering in @breadcrumbs [ 'new-blog-post' ]`. That
isn't what I expected and it is unfortunate that `'blog'` isn't added to our catch-all. If we want to render breadcrumbs
that include `blog` then we'll have to add an additional page in our `@breadcrumb` slot.

We'll make another file at `app/@breadcrumbs/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`.

```typescript jsx
type Props = {
  params: {
    slug: string
  }
}
export default function BreadcrumbsSlot({params: { slug } }: Props) {
  console.log("rendering in @breadcrumbs", slug)
  return <div>placeholder</div>
}
```

Now we will be able to customize the breadcrumbs specifically for our `blog` route.

<Aside heading="Can this be improved?">
  I'll be keeping my eye on this feature and whether or not the static routes
  can be added to the catch-all. It may not be feasible, but for a larger site
  that has many different static routes I would think that being able to define
  a single `page.tsx` to build all the breadcrumbs for the entire site would be
  preferred.

## shadcn/ui Breadcrumb

I use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the components on this website and will be laying out how to use the
route parameters to build the breadcrumbs using components from it. However, the same principles should apply to
components from any library. We'll be using the [Breadcrumb](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/breadcrumb) to build
out our own `Breadcrumbs` component. Given that we have an array of nested routes (from our logged output above) we'll
need to construct longer and longer `href` attributes to pass into the `BreadcrumbLink` component. I decided to use a
regular old `for` loop because I've been doing a bunch of data structures practice but if you want to use
`routes.forEach`, go for it; either way, the concept is the same. We will build out clickable links for every part of the
route except for the final one, which will be just a static representation of the current page as a `BreadcrumbPage`.

```typescript jsx
import React, {ReactElement} from "react";

import {
  Breadcrumb,
  BreadcrumbItem,
  BreadcrumbLink,
  BreadcrumbList,
  BreadcrumbPage,
  BreadcrumbSeparator
} from "@/components/ui/breadcrumb";

export function Breadcrumbs({routes = []}: {routes: string[]}) {
  let fullHref: string | undefined = undefined;
  const breadcrumbItems: ReactElement[] = [];
  let breadcrumbPage: ReactElement = (<></>);

  for(let i = 0; i < routes.length; i++) {
    const route = routes[i];
    let href;

    href = fullHref ? `${fullHref}/${route}` : `/${route}`
    fullHref = href

    if (i === routes.length-1) {
      breadcrumbPage = (
        <BreadcrumbItem>
          <BreadcrumbPage>{route}</BreadcrumbPage>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
      )
    } else {
      breadcrumbItems.push(
        <React.Fragment key={href}>
          <BreadcrumbSeparator />
          <BreadcrumbItem>
            <BreadcrumbLink href={href}>{route}</BreadcrumbLink>
          </BreadcrumbItem>
        </React.Fragment>
      )
    }
  }

  return (
    <Breadcrumb>
      <BreadcrumbList>
        <BreadcrumbItem>
          <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
        {breadcrumbItems}
        <BreadcrumbSeparator />
        {breadcrumbPage}
      </BreadcrumbList>
    </Breadcrumb>
  )
}
```

Now that we have our `Breadcrumbs` component we can update our slots to render it.

```typescript jsx
// app/@breadcrumbs/[...catchAll]/page.tsx
import { Breadcrumbs } from "@/components/breadcrumbs";
type Props = {
  params: {
    catchAll: string[]
  }
}
export default function BreadcrumbSlot({params: { catchAll } }: Props) {
  return <Breadcrumbs routes={catchAll} />
}
```

```typescript jsx
// app/@breadcrumbs/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import { Breadcrumbs } from "@/components/breadcrumbs";
type Props = {
  params: {
    slug: string
  }
}
export default function BreadcrumbSlot({params: { slug } }: Props) {
  return <Breadcrumbs routes={["blog", slug]} />
}
```

For the catch-all, we only need to pass the `catchAll` array into `Breadcrumbs`, however for our blog implementation we
have to append the `"blog"` portion ourselves.

## Conclusion

The final file structure of the application looks like this

```
/
  app/
    [first]/
      [middle]/
        [last]/
          page.tsx
    blog/
      [slug]/
        page.tsx
    @breadcrumb/
      [...catchAll]/
        page.tsx
      blog/
        [slug]/
          page.tsx
      default.tsx
```

I hope you were able to learn a little bit more about how the App Router works with Parallel Routes and how slots can
be used to render different data depending on the route. I think this is a really powerful concept that I'll be
exploring more in the future.
