  I've wanted to add filenames to my inline code blocks since I built this blog.
  I finally did it and got the styling just how I wanted!

import { BasicDiv } from "@/components/mdx/basic-div";

Sometimes I finish writing some code and it just brings me happiness. That is what happened over the past few days
while I was writing my previous blog post about
[Adding Email Address Verification in Rails 8](https://jeremykreutzbender.com/blog/adding-email-address-verification-in-rails-8).
For the longest time I've wanted to add a header to code blocks so that I could attach a filename to help with
understanding where the code is meant to written to. I had tried to use some different Rehype and Remark plugins in the past but
they never quite worked as I wanted. This time around I told myself I was going to figure out how to make it happen
and I'm super happy with the results. Here is the finished result.

````md:blog-post.mdx
```md:blog-post.mdx
This is a code block with a filename!
```

## rehype-code-titles

I ended up using [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles) to add this functionality.
It does exactly what I needed it to do but a caveat is that it adds a completely unstyled `div` element. In the end,
that is good because we don't have to fight to override styles, but it look a little bit to figure out how to get
the styling correct.

Adding `rehype-code-titles` to Next.js is very easy using the `createMDX` functionality from `@next/mdx`.

```js:next.config
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
import rehypeCodeTitles from "rehype-code-titles";

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeCodeTitles],
  },
});
```

The [Output](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles?tab=readme-ov-file#output) documentation from
`rehype-code-titles` shows that the HTML that is generated looks like this.

```html
<div class="rehype-code-title">lib/mdx.ts</div>
<pre>
  <code class="language-typescript">
  <!-- HTML parse code here -->
  </code>
</pre>
```

This is great, we have a `div` that has our filename in it! However the HTML output by my blog is a little more complex due
to having light and dark themes provided by the [bright](https://github.com/code-hike/bright) package. The HTML
that is output for this site looks like this.

```html
<div class="rehype-code-title">lib/mdx.ts</div>
<div data-bright-theme="solarized-dark" data-bright-mode="dark" style="...">
  <pre> ... </pre>
</div>
<div data-bright-theme="solarized-light" data-bright-mode="light" style="...">
  <pre> ... </pre>
</div>
```

Here is an example of what the output looked like before styling.

<BasicDiv text="app/controllers/users_controller.rb" />
```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
end
```

The `<div data-bright-theme="..." data-bright-mode="..." style="...">` elements add margin to separate
themselves from sibling elements so the resulting `div` from `rehype-code-titles` looked quite out of place.
I ended up using [v0](https://v0.dev/) and pasting in a screenshot of what I was trying to accomplish. I'll admit
that my knowledge of correct terminology for CSS questions is lacking and I learned a lot about how to target
specific elements through this conversation. I think that AI having the ability to interpret UI screenshots and
lead a conversation to the correct terminology is such a great experience!

## MDX Components

I haven't talked much about how the MDX Components feature of Next.js has played an important role in all of this.
As I was iterating on the styling for the `<div class="rehype-code-title">` I wanted
to be able to add a background color to the entire `div` and then have a different color encompass just the text
portion that was being shown. I was finding this incredibly difficult to solve and multiple attempts of different
`::before` and `::after` pseudo elements ended up failing (could have been skill issues). That is when I realized
that I could create and render my own component.

I went ahead and made a change that whenever a `div` is rendered, check to see if it has the `rehype-code-title` class.
If so, we'll render a custom component otherwise we'll render the `div` as it was.

```typescript:mdx-components.tsx
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // ...
  div: ({ className, children, ...props }) => {
		if (className?.includes("rehype-code-title")) {
			return <CodeblockTitle {...props}>{children}</CodeblockTitle>;
		}
		return (
			<div className={className} {...props}>
				{children}
			</div>
		);
	},
  // ...
}
```

I went ahead and created the `CodeblockTitle` component where I inserted a `span` element inside of the `div` to
give myself the ability to add a different colored background to the text portion.

```typescript:components/mdx/codeblock-title.tsx
export function CodeblockTitle({
	className,
	children,
	...props
}: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>) {
	return (
		<div
			className="rehype-code-title pt-4 px-4 pb-0 rounded-t-md mb-0
			text-sm font-normal bg-solaralizedlight-darkened dark:bg-solaralizeddark-darkened"
			{...props}
		>
			<span
			className="rehype-code-title-content relative p-1 -left-[6px] top-[6px]
			inline-block whitespace-nowrap overflow-x-auto max-w-full
			bg-solaralizedlight dark:bg-solaralizeddark"
			>
				{children}
			</span>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Conclusion

I had a ton of fun implementing this, learned a bit about CSS, and this blog looks, in my opinion, a whole lot
cooler being able to have the filename next to the code block. Sometimes it's the little things that bring us the most
happiness!
