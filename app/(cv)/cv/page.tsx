            As a Software Engineer I have taken projects from initial idea to
            completion on my own as well as within a team. I have led projects
            as an engineer but also managed ticket writing and prioritization. I
            highly value collaboration and insights from my colleagues.

                  Migrated build system to Buildkit which reduced build times by
                  50% and unlocked horizontal scaling

                  Built a webhook processing system to ingest and normalize
                  webhooks from GitHub, Gitlab, and Bitbucket. After
                  normalization, trigger pipelines to carry out tasks such as
                  creating new environments or triggering deploys to existing

                  Rebuilt UI using Next.js, Typescript, and GraphQL. Modernized
                  the look of the site with Chakra UI. Reduced cold page load
                  times by an average of 20% but also took advantage of SWR
                  strategy to make subsequent navigation instantaneous

                    Worked on an internal tool (Ruby on Rails / React) which

                    Rebuilt the New Car traffic funnel ($200m/yr business at the

                    on each funnel step to ensure NFE did not drop. Reduced page
