# Work Experience - [Release](https://release.com)

Release is a company born out of a large migration project that took place at TrueCar from 2017-2019. That project
encompassed many facets, one being a consolidation of technologies onto Ruby on Rails backend projects
and React based frontend projects. I've discussed the projects I was involved in on the
[TrueCar Experience Page](/experience/truecar#projects), however there was a project that I was a consumer of which was
the internal developer platform. That IDP allowed for the creation of ephemeral environments, ran our CI/CD pipelines,
and unlocked the ability for the engineering team to go from deploying code once a week to deploying multiple times a
day in an automated fashion whenever merges to the main branch happened.

However, building and maintaining a first class IDP was not a core competency of a online car buying and selling website.
The thought was that if a company like TrueCar could see such a difference in their engineering teams ability to deliver
product then taking the idea of the IDP and turning it into a business might not be a bad idea.

> For example, if you sell shoes on the Internet, you want to spend money and time on developing easier checkout,
> faster delivery, removing barriers to purchase, running a/b tests on marketing/language/features, etc.
> Building a highly scalable, fast, reliable CI/CD PaaS doesn’t directly help you do any of these things,
> but it does help you do whatever it is you do faster, safer and more reliably. All things being equal “Speed Wins”.
> Being faster than your competitors is a strategic advantage.

This was a quote we wrote (back when we called it a PaaS, not an IDP) that took our experience from TrueCar but turned it into a generic example

## Projects

This is not a comprehensive list of everything I did while working at Release. Instead, this is
a expansion of the highlights from the [CV](/cv) page as well as some additional information on the technologies
that were used.

### Original UI

The original UI for Release was built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and
[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/). When the project was started these were sensible choices to get a React
project off the ground but we eventually felt that the website looked dated and that we wanted more flexibility in our
framework (see the **New UI - Next.js** section for more details).

### Migrating to Buildkit and Buildx

Part of what Release offers is a platform for building Docker images as those images are needed to deploy containers in
Kubernetes. The original build process leveraged the fact that Kubernetes came with a Docker daemon and using Ruby threading
we were able to simulate multiple builds in parallel. That processed worked but it felt very brittle and was not proving
to build things very efficiently.

I had learned about [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) when I attended Dockercon in 2019 and when I started
doing research on how we could make our build platform more efficient I discovered a new tool that Docker was working on
called [buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx). The [v.0.4.0](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
added support for a Kubernetes driver and it seemed that we had found exactly what we were looking for in terms
of a scalable solution to providing builds for our customers.

I wrote more about the experience and how much improvement in build times we were able to achieve in
[Cutting Build Time In Half with Docker’s Buildx Kubernetes Driver](https://release.com/blog/cutting-build-time-in-half-docker-buildx-kubernetes).
This solution also allowed us to remove our dependency of the Docker daemon in Kubernetes which was announced in
[Don't Panic: Kubernetes and Docker](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) thus allowing
us to safely upgrade to v1.24 when that time came.
